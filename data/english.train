<69.4829707887:78.0439707887:Paula_Zahn:8> First of all here 's a quick track of some of the stories 0 we 're following *T*-1 tonight /.
<69.4829707887:78.0439707887:Paula_Zahn:8> President Bush unveiled a seven point one billion dollar plan <78.0525803311:86.1893303311:Paula_Zahn:9> 0 *T*-1 to help *PRO* protect Americans against the threat from bird flu /.

<86.2317429406:91.2463203505:Paula_Zahn:10> The president says 0 there is no immediate threat but there is cause for concern /.
<91.2560856865:99.8625462512:Paula_Zahn:11> In Washington tensions are high after an unsual Senate session /.
<91.2560856865:99.8625462512:Paula_Zahn:11> Democrats used a little used rule *PRO*-1 to force a special closed session /.
<99.9026290166:109.965206426:Paula_Zahn:12> Democrats say 0 it <disfluency> is </disfluency> was *PRO* to force Republican leaders *PRO*-1 to complete a long promised investigation into how Bush administration officials handled pre-war intelligence on Iraq *T*-2 /.
<110.009737098:114.037891918:Paula_Zahn:13> Republicans for their part are calling it *PRO*-1 a political stunt /.
<114.099318403:119.265662123:Paula_Zahn:14> And Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld says 0 more American troops could soon be heading to Iraq /.

<128.52969815:140.97869815:Paula_Zahn:16> But we begin tonight with an ongoing mystery /.
<128.52969815:140.97869815:Paula_Zahn:16> Who is that lone man discovered * last month *PRO* frozen * in California 's Sierra Nevada mountains with just a few tantalizing clues to his identity *T*-1 /?
<141.032132425:149.51177702:Paula_Zahn:17> This we do know *T*-1 at this hour /.
<141.032132425:149.51177702:Paula_Zahn:17> The man died more than sixty years ago /.
<141.032132425:149.51177702:Paula_Zahn:17> He was in the military apparently a World War Two airman /.
<149.620253165:162.840407984:Paula_Zahn:18> And while it looks like his plane crashed in the mountains so did *T*-1 *ICH*-2 twenty - five other planes around the same time /.  <149.620253165:162.840407984:Paula_Zahn:18> Thelma Gutierrez went inside the forensic laboratory where scientists are trying *PRO*-1 to solve this mystery *T*-2 /.

<162.9406037:173.59275852:Thelma_Gutierrez:19> An address book a plastic comb a vintage penny /.
<162.9406037:173.59275852:Thelma_Gutierrez:19> You 're looking at the last things 0 a young airman put *T*-1 into his pockets on the day 0 he died *T*-2 <173.690360273:180.53676631:Thelma_Gutierrez:20> clues to a World War Two cold case that you 're about *PRO*-3 to see *T*-4 for the very first time /.
<181.763640701:197.57776631:Thelma_Gutierrez:21> It is a mystery that *T*-1 begins high in the Sierra Nevada Mountains at the bottom of a glacier /.
<181.763640701:197.57776631:Thelma_Gutierrez:21> Two weeks ago climbers discovered a frozen man face down in the snow still in his army air force uniform and an unopened silk parachute /.
<197.643622201:216.87177702:Thelma_Gutierrez:22> After six decades the airman is exhumed *-1 from his icy tomb and thawed *-1 out /.
<197.643622201:216.87177702:Thelma_Gutierrez:22> but he 's wearing no military dog tags or ~ID /.
<197.643622201:216.87177702:Thelma_Gutierrez:22> Did this World War Two pilot perish when his training flight crashed in the mountains like twenty - five other ill fated flights more than sixty years ago *T*-1 /?
<216.927899687:233.267507837:Thelma_Gutierrez:23> The search for clues takes us to Honolulu Hawaii to the joint ~powmia accounting command or <uncertain> jpac </uncertain> /.
<216.927899687:233.267507837:Thelma_Gutierrez:23> The mystery of the frozen airman is just one of more than a thousand different unsolved cases that scientists here at <uncertain> jpac </uncertain> are trying *PRO*-1 to solve *T*-2 /.
<233.29153605:243.28353605:Thelma_Gutierrez:24> In this laboratory alone I 'm surrounded *-1 by the remains of at least twenty different service members who *T*-2 are in the process of *PRO*-3 being identified *-4 so that they too can go home /.
<243.385579937:254.061188088:Thelma_Gutierrez:25> The investigation begins with a team of forensic specialists who *T*-1 probe and study the airman 's bones teeth and his belongings *PRO*-2 to piece together who he is *T*-3 /.
<254.106583072:260.332887147:Thelma_Gutierrez:26> And almost immediately clues begin *-1 to surface /.
<260.438871473:267.553175549:Thelma_Gutierrez:27> Dr. Robert Mann a forensic anthropologist has determined that the airman was Caucasian and had fair hair /.
<267.586206897:270.253416928:Dr_Mann:28> Next though <disfluency> I 've got -- </disfluency> I 'm going *-1 to have *-2 to look at <disfluency> his </disfluency> his clavicles /.
<270.219435737:277.003733542:Thelma_Gutierrez:29> The airman 's collar bones and pelvic bones prove that he was in his twenties and died in an airplane crash /.
<277.115987461:282.901940439:Thelma_Gutierrez:30> This is a person who *T*-1 likely died on impact versus *PRO* perhaps freezing to death up in the mountains /.
<282.821316614:293.011836991:Dr_Mann:31> I think that <disfluency> the </disfluency> uh the injuries were so substantial um and severe that <disfluency> it it wo- </disfluency> he would n't have felt anything /.
<282.821316614:293.011836991:Dr_Mann:31> He would have died immediately /.
<282.821316614:293.011836991:Dr_Mann:31> One two /-
<292.978056426:294.735996865:Thelma_Gutierrez:32> Another important clue /.
<294.670846395:299.181015674:Dr_Mann:33> He has a significant number of uh fillings /.
<299.184952978:303.881952978:Thelma_Gutierrez:34> Like the bones xrays of his wisdom teeth also tell us something about his age /.
<303.887147335:311.154404389:Dr_Mann:35> Root tips <disfluency> are </disfluency> are closed *-1 /.
<303.887147335:311.154404389:Dr_Mann:35> they 're sealed *-2 up which *T*-3 is more indicative of someone who *T*-4 would be at least twenty - one years old /.
<311.159874608:319.472448276:Thelma_Gutierrez:36> And Dr. Andy Henry notices something else /.
<311.159874608:319.472448276:Thelma_Gutierrez:36> The airmen have straight teeth /.
<311.159874608:319.472448276:Thelma_Gutierrez:36> so he had a nice smile good teeth /.
<316.990595611:319.800899687:Dr_Henry:37> Yes I would have *-1 to say that yes /.
<319.811912226:328.417952978:Thelma_Gutierrez:38> Then there are the material clues the things 0 he had *T*-1 on him when he died *T*-2 that *T*-3 offer a snapshot into who he could have been *T*-4 /.
<328.401253918:329.829112853:Dr_Mann:39> <uncertain> If </uncertain> there 's a badge or anything else <uncertain> that </uncertain> /-
<329.780564263:338.421388715:Thelma_Gutierrez:40> We know 0 he was wearing a World War Two army air force uniform /.
<329.780564263:338.421388715:Thelma_Gutierrez:40> Remnants of his sweater undergarments and socks are still intact /.
<338.432601881:348.048426332:Thelma_Gutierrez:41> And more clues emerge from his tattered uniform a corroded nameplate this pin on his collar and this army aircorps insignia /.
<348.02507837:351.283984326:Dr_Mann:42> When I found these insignia *T*-1 I was happy *PRO*-2 to see them /.
<351.222570533:358.772725295:Thelma_Gutierrez:43> And our young white - haired airman also carried this black comb and some pocket change forty - five cents worth /.
<358.746081505:363.134380336:Dr_Mann:44> Some of these dimes are <uncertain> in </uncertain> *PRO*-1 ranging from nineteen thirty - six to nineteen forty - two /.
<363.072100313:377.196685498:Thelma_Gutierrez:45> In his uniform breast pocket Dr. Paul <uncertain> Emanovsky </uncertain> found this vintage <uncertain> Schafer </uncertain> pen and three small leatherbound address books /.
<363.072100313:377.196685498:Thelma_Gutierrez:45> The pages have been decomposing /.
<363.072100313:377.196685498:Thelma_Gutierrez:45> but could they contain names of friends and loved ones /?
<377.178683386:379.832034911:Dr_Emanovsky:46> And we 're going *-1 to put it in a spectral comparator /.
<379.749216301:384.485725017:Thelma_Gutierrez:47> At first nothing /.
<379.749216301:384.485725017:Thelma_Gutierrez:47> then like magic clues begin *-1 to emerge /.
<384.514106583:393.624347921:Dr_Emanovsky:48> Uh you can see all these letters from the calendar Sunday Monday Tuesday *ICH*-1 up at the top one nine four and two /.
<393.605015674:394.887043538:Thelma_Gutierrez:49> Nineteen forty - two /.
<394.796238245:395.556147465:Dr_Emanovsky:50> Yeah /.
<395.548589342:404.609378854:Thelma_Gutierrez:51> After hours of meticulous examination of each address book they yield no personal information clues that *T*-1 could have faded with time /.
<404.702194357:412.760957172:Thelma_Gutierrez:52> And so while we still do not know who our twenty - something fair - haired airman is *T*-1 enormous progress has been made *-2 /.
<412.789968652:420.786030371:Thelma_Gutierrez:53> Out of the thousands of unidentified World War Two service members Dr. Mann says 0 they 've narrowed it down to just ten *T*-1 /.
<420.815047022:437.940019608:Thelma_Gutierrez:54> So what was it *EXP*-1 like *T*-2 *PRO* to grow up there /?
<420.815047022:437.940019608:Thelma_Gutierrez:54> In Pleasant Grove we recently met these three sisters all in their eighties who *T*-1 have high hopes that the frozen airman proves *-2 to be their big brother Glen Munn whose plane *T*-3 went *PRO*-4 missing in the Sierra back in nineteen forty - two /.
<437.931034483:449.387360736:sister_one:55> Oh I just wanted <disfluency> the final -- </disfluency> you know *PRO*-1 to know that he was found *-2 and that we can have him brought *-3 home here <disfluency> to </disfluency> for burial and /-
<449.34169279:451.500696698:sister_two:56> We do n't know that though /.
<451.410658307:453.403435911:sister_one:57> We do n't *?* /.
<451.410658307:453.403435911:sister_one:57> but that 's my wishes /.
<457.492163009:476.212300343:Thelma_Gutierrez:58> And until they learn otherwise they say 0 they will keep that hope *PRO*-1 alive /.
<457.492163009:476.212300343:Thelma_Gutierrez:58> And in the weeks and months ahead scientists are convinced *-1 0 they will identify this airman and return him home to his family wherever they might be *T*-2 /.
<457.492163009:476.212300343:Thelma_Gutierrez:58> Thelma Gutierrez ~CNN Honolulu Hawaii /.
<476.294930876:490.659723166:Paula_Zahn:59> And there are some new developments 0 *PRO* to talk about *T*-1 tonight /.
<476.294930876:490.659723166:Paula_Zahn:59> Scientists may be even closer to *PRO*-1 solving the mystery /.
<476.294930876:490.659723166:Paula_Zahn:59> For an update we 're joined *-1 by Dr. Robert Mann one of the senior scientists 0 you just saw *T*-2 working on this cold case /.
<476.294930876:490.659723166:Paula_Zahn:59> Thanks for *PRO* spending time with us tonight doctor /.
<490.783410138:498.09690542:Paula_Zahn:60> We understand 0 since Thelma left your laboratories you 've now wittled this down to perhaps four airmen /.
<490.783410138:498.09690542:Paula_Zahn:60> is that true /?
<498.082949309:507.066221104:Dr_Mann:61> Well hi Paula /.
<498.082949309:507.066221104:Dr_Mann:61> yes we have *?* /.
<498.082949309:507.066221104:Dr_Mann:61> Uh when the remains came in a little over a week ago *T*-1 our analysts and historians got to work on that /.
<498.082949309:507.066221104:Dr_Mann:61> and they were able *PRO*-2 to wittle it *ICH*-3 down <507.152073733:516.500115343:Dr_Mann:62> the number of missing aircraft uh to a few /.
<507.152073733:516.500115343:Dr_Mann:62> and at this point they 've wittled it down to one aircraft and a missing crew of four individuals /.
<516.608294931:523.198323538:Dr_Mann:63> So we 've gone from several possible aircraft to one aircraft and from several missing airmen to four /.
<523.188940092:527.521670246:Paula_Zahn:64> So how much easier will that make it *EXP*-2 *T*-1 for you to unlock this case , do you think /?
<527.502304147:537.973584549:Dr_Mann:65> Well I think 0 it 'll help quite a bit /.
<527.502304147:537.973584549:Dr_Mann:65> Um any time 0 you 've got <disfluency> a </disfluency> a body uh or remains like this that *T*-1 has come in and they 're in pretty good condition such as this one is *?* , it 's mummified remains *T*-2 /.
<537.98816568:550.204601735:Dr_Mann:66> We have some soft tissue 0 we can deal with *T*-1 /.
<537.98816568:550.204601735:Dr_Mann:66> so we can look at the color of the hair /.
<537.98816568:550.204601735:Dr_Mann:66> we can tell right away the race and the sex of the individual /.
<537.98816568:550.204601735:Dr_Mann:66> but then there are other things that *T*-2 are hidden *-3 beneath the soft tissue that *T*-4 are revealed *-5 only in the skeleton /.
<537.98816568:550.204601735:Dr_Mann:66> and that 's where we 're going to *T*-6 now /.
<550.177514793:568.661914903:Paula_Zahn:67> So in the interest of full disclosure what I know *T*-1 about forensics is basically what I 've learned *T*-2 on ~CSI /.
<550.177514793:568.661914903:Paula_Zahn:67> and one would think that because you 've got it now narrowed *-3 down to four potential airmen that perhaps you could go to four families get strands of hair and try *PRO*-4 to do a potential ~DNA match with what you 've found *T*-5 in the ice /.
<550.177514793:568.661914903:Paula_Zahn:67> Is it not that simple /?
<568.639053254:577.960065945:Dr_Mann:68> Well no no it 's not that simple /.
<568.639053254:577.960065945:Dr_Mann:68> Um one thing 0 we always caution people about *T*-1 is the pool <disfluency> of </disfluency> of aircraft and missing airmen could be larger than what we 're looking at *T*-2 /.
<577.98816568:586.805972336:Dr_Mann:69> And what we want *PRO*-1 to do *T*-2 is we do n't want *PRO*-3 to just look at the material evidence that we have *T*-4 and immediately <disfluency> make a -- </disfluency> um jump to a conclusion that this is a certain individual /.
<586.923076923:594.431168369:Dr_Mann:70> What we want *PRO*-1 to do *T*-2 is *PRO* have the evidence speak for itself /.
<586.923076923:594.431168369:Dr_Mann:70> and when we look at this individual *T*-3 we 've done as we 've done the biological profile *PRO* looking at his remains <594.437869822:601.173319531:Dr_Mann:71> his bones his teeth and the material evidence /.
<594.437869822:601.173319531:Dr_Mann:71> and what we 're able *PRO*-4 to tell *T*-5 from this individual is that <disfluency> he is -- </disfluency> he died in his twenties <601.183431953:609.324820821:Dr_Mann:72> he stood *PRO*-6 somewhere between five foot nine and six foot two inches tall um he sustained massive trauma to his body on impact /.
<609.349112426:617.379179641:Dr_Mann:73> And <disfluency> we have -- </disfluency> he 's Caucasoid male /.
<609.349112426:617.379179641:Dr_Mann:73> and so we know much more *ICH*-1 now just one week later than what we did *T*-2 when he came in about eight days ago *T*-3 /.
<617.396449704:623.010847924:Paula_Zahn:74> So the most important question is when do you think 0 you 're going *-1 to know exactly who he is *T*-2 *T*-3 /?

<1919.95941689:1931.25641689:Dr_Gupto:188> You know what *T*-1 's sort of interesting Paula /.
<1919.95941689:1931.25641689:Dr_Gupto:188> on one hand <disfluency> it is -- </disfluency> it *EXP*-2 is remarkable that the president is devoting as much time and as much money uh all towards a disease that *T*-3 does n't exist yet /.
<1919.95941689:1931.25641689:Dr_Gupto:188> Pandemic flu does n't exist yet /.  <1931.25641689:1937.5761715:Dr_Gupto:189> But a lot of people are talking about it /.
<1931.25641689:1937.5761715:Dr_Gupto:189> and I think 0 that 's remarkable to a lot of people <disfluency> who *T*-1 are -- </disfluency> eh who *T*-2 are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well /.
<1937.5761715:1956.3051715:Dr_Gupto:190> On the other hand *PRO* to be able *PRO*-1 to outline and do the thing that *T*-2 were talked about *-5 today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that *T*-3 can talk to federal officials to be able *PRO* to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens *T*-4 that takes probably a lot more money <disfluency> and a </disfluency> and <disfluency> a </disfluency> really a complete revamping of our public health systems /.
<1956.36197441:1967.36892687:Dr_Gupto:191> The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that <disfluency> our- </disfluency> we 're a lot better at *PRO* taking care of patients now than we were *?* in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ~ICUs a lot of ~ICUs in the hospital behind me that *T*-1 can take care of critically ill patients /.
<1967.36892687:1982.71392687:Dr_Gupto:192> The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ~ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that *ICH*-2 's going *-1 to cost lots and lots of money *PRO* to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that *T*-3 might come in with a pandemic *T*-4 Paula /.
<1982.71392687:1998.45092687:Paula_Zahn:193> Uh *PRO* let 's talk about the other <uncertain> problem </uncertain> of the plan where the president <disfluency> will spend uh or -- </disfluency> wants *PRO*-1 to spend a billion dollars *PRO* to stockpile antiviral medicine like <uncertain> Tamaflu </uncertain> and <uncertain> Rolenza </uncertain> *T*-2 /.
<1982.71392687:1998.45092687:Paula_Zahn:193> Do we even know if these two medications are going *-1 to be effective against a strain that *T*-2 has n't even presented itself /?
<1998.45092687:2016.46010238:Dr_Gupto:194> <disfluency> Here </disfluency> here 's the important thing about that /.
<1998.45092687:2016.46010238:Dr_Gupto:194> We do n't know for sure /.
<1998.45092687:2016.46010238:Dr_Gupto:194> A lot of people focusing a lot of energy on <uncertain> Tamaflu </uncertain> and <uncertain> Rolenza </uncertain> /.
<1998.45092687:2016.46010238:Dr_Gupto:194> These are antiviral drugs /.
<1998.45092687:2016.46010238:Dr_Gupto:194> they are not vaccines /.
<1998.45092687:2016.46010238:Dr_Gupto:194> They are antiviral drugs uh designed * *PRO*-1 to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you *T*-2 uh try *PRO*-3 to lessen its impact /.
<2016.47502356:2028.03712441:Dr_Gupto:195> But we only know that it might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular /.
<2016.47502356:2028.03712441:Dr_Gupto:195> The way 0 *PRO* to really study it *T*-1 would be *PRO* to knowingly expose people to bird flu /.
<2016.47502356:2028.03712441:Dr_Gupto:195> and nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons /.
<2028.03712441:2031.52806975:Dr_Gupto:196> So it *EXP*-1 's just theoretical really for the most part that those will work Paula /.

<1421.98909688:1429.71809688:Rick_Sanchez:210> Well here in the state of Utah because the father had custody of the child they 've been divorced *-1 now for uh three years he would be able *PRO*-2 to make the decision /.
<1429.71809688:1443.91690649:Rick_Sanchez:211> However if the mother decides that she wants *PRO*-1 to take him to court *PRO* to see if her decision is allowed *-2 all the folks in this uh state that I have talked to *T*-3 who *T*-4 've dealt with matters like this in the past say that judges usually allow the evidence *ICH*-6 to be heard *-5 from both sides /.

<2209.8013591:2211.18121672:Anderson_Cooper:303> What are the similarities to humans *T*-1 /?
<2211.18121672:2214.68255034:Anderson_Cooper:304> I mean everyone always says <disfluency> how </disfluency> how you know much like humans they appear *PRO*-2 *T*-1 /.

<2237.97031361:2238.8396944:Anderson_Cooper:311> That 's amazing /.
<2238.7385992:2239.3395992:Jack_Hannah:312> Unbelieveable /.
<2239.3395992:2243.91533383:Anderson_Cooper:313> Wow <disfluency> i- </disfluency> eh the genocide I mean <disfluency> it it </disfluency> it permeates everything still in Rwanda /.
<2243.91533383:2246.36285784:Anderson_Cooper:314> I mean Kagame has done a remarkable job with the country /.
<2246.36285784:2250.37476264:Anderson_Cooper:315> Um <disfluency> i- i- how did you -- </disfluency> I mean how has it impacted on the animals *T*-1 /?
<2250.37476264:2254.6396211:Jack_Hannah:316> Well <disfluency> as </disfluency> <disfluency> as far as the animals </disfluency> uh <disfluency> President Kagame </disfluency> uh a lot of the refugees came back in /.
<2254.6396211:2261.08352591:Jack_Hannah:317> Some of them got into the parks /.
<2254.6396211:2261.08352591:Jack_Hannah:317> but now what he 's done *T*-1 , he 's protected those parks where no one absolutely nobody 's allowed *PRO*-2 to go inside the park boundaries now *T*-3 /.
<2261.08352591:2266.45538353:Jack_Hannah:318> Uh the gorillas are coming back seventeen percent /.
<2261.08352591:2266.45538353:Jack_Hannah:318> tourism is up /.
<2261.08352591:2266.45538353:Jack_Hannah:318> as I said *?* Lake Akagera National Park is incredible /.

<2266.45538353:2275.28038353:Jack_Hannah:319> and so you can go to one of the only countries in Africa and see the chimpanzees in the wild as well as the gorillas /.
<2275.28038353:2280.33881234:Anderson_Cooper:320> You also worked with a woman uh Rosamond Carr who *T*-1 runs an orphanage /.

<2275.28038353:2280.33881234:Anderson_Cooper:320> and you have some video uh <disfluency> of </disfluency> of what she has done *T*-2 /.
<2276.96714406:2278.48357203:Jack_Hannah:321> Oh gosh /.
<2280.33881234:2284.60381234:Anderson_Cooper:322> She 's been there uh <disfluency> for </disfluency> for years and <disfluency> i- </disfluency> is a legend in that country /.
<2282.12299916:2283.43723673:Jack_Hannah:323> For about forty - five years /.
<2284.60381234:2286.07533635:Anderson_Cooper:324> Uh she 's a remarkable lady /.
<2286.07533635:2300.11633635:Jack_Hannah:325> Yeah she really is *?* /.
<2286.07533635:2300.11633635:Jack_Hannah:325> We 've given the Columbus Zoo and al- /-

<2286.07533635:2300.11633635:Jack_Hannah:325> so we 're <disfluency> tr- </disfluency> uh teaching people how *PRO* to <disfluency> be p- </disfluency> have productive lives in Rwanda *T*-2 /.
<2300.11633635:2308.52819398:Jack_Hannah:326> This is her right here /.
<2300.11633635:2308.52819398:Jack_Hannah:326> and these are the kids by the way in the old orphange /.
<2300.11633635:2308.52819398:Jack_Hannah:326> and now she 's moving them up to her home in the mountains about an hour out of Kasenji as you well know on the border of the Democratic Republic of Congo /.
<2308.52819398:2313.81352759:Jack_Hannah:327> And what we did *T*-1 , we brought all sorts of things <disfluency> for </disfluency> for the orphans there incredible incredible children /.
<2313.81352759:2316.96652759:Anderson_Cooper:328> And these are kids whose parents *T*-1 <disfluency> w- </disfluency> were killed *-2 in the genocide /.
<2315.88879528:2317.00084246:Jack_Hannah:329> Exactly /.
<2317.06762279:2324.53843239:Jack_Hannah:330> <disfluency> And and </disfluency> and by the way it 's all one Rwanda right now as we were talking /.
<2317.06762279:2324.53843239:Jack_Hannah:330> no Tutsis and Hutus anymore /.
<2317.06762279:2324.53843239:Jack_Hannah:330> President Kagame said 0 it 's all one Rwanda , we all are together now /.
<2324.53843239:2329.393242:Anderson_Cooper:331> <disfluency> I- it 's -- </disfluency> it 's interesting because you go there and people are offended *-1 if you ask are you Hutu or are you Tutsi /.
<2328.28119482:2329.5229564:Jack_Hannah:332> Exactly /.
<2329.393242:2331.77457561:Anderson_Cooper:333> Because <disfluency> th- i- th- </disfluency> eh they do n't want those divisions /.
<2331.57238522:2341.78790923:Jack_Hannah:334> No they do n't want those divisions /.
<2331.57238522:2341.78790923:Jack_Hannah:334> and yet they all <disfluency> li- h- </disfluency> live together /.
<2331.57238522:2341.78790923:Jack_Hannah:334> and you would think that they would have that division /.
<2331.57238522:2341.78790923:Jack_Hannah:334> but you sure do n't have it /.
<2331.57238522:2341.78790923:Jack_Hannah:334> you have a tremendous love there /.
<2331.57238522:2341.78790923:Jack_Hannah:334> and by the way it 's probably now the cleanest country 0 I 've ever seen *T*-1 in Africa /.
<2341.78790923:2343.76526643:Jack_Hannah:335> <disfluency> I </disfluency> I could not believe what I s- /-
<2342.29938606:2343.96224284:Anderson_Cooper:336> And the road system is incredibile /.  <2342.29938606:2343.96224284:Anderson_Cooper:336> they 're good <unintelligible> /.
<2343.96224284:2355.41924284:Anderson_Cooper:337> <disfluency> Y- y- </disfluency> what *T*-1 's amazing too is 0 you go *PRO*-2 to see the gorillas and you start *-3 talking to the guides who *T*-4 are taking you up and you ask them did you lose anyone and they will just turn and without *PRO* blinking an eye tell you you know <disfluency> my </disfluency> all my family is gone /.
<2355.41924284:2367.94967166:Jack_Hannah:338> Yeah <disfluency> i- </disfluency> we had a guide do the same exact thing /.
<2355.41924284:2367.94967166:Jack_Hannah:338> <disfluency> and </disfluency> and <disfluency> i- </disfluency> we said <disfluency> how h- </disfluency> where 's your <disfluency> par- </disfluency> family *T*-1 /.
<2355.41924284:2367.94967166:Jack_Hannah:338> and he said <disfluency> w- y- we </disfluency> I lost my dad and then goes right along and talks to his buddy who *T*-2 might be <disfluency> a h- </disfluency> a Hutu or a Tutsi /.
<2355.41924284:2367.94967166:Jack_Hannah:338> and so /-
<2355.41924284:2367.94967166:Jack_Hannah:338> but they never ever mention that uh whatsoever /.
<2367.94967166:2371.26267166:Jack_Hannah:339> But I think 0 it 's the greatest turnaround of any country in the world in the last eh ten years /.
<2370.15062448:2372.93057646:Anderson_Cooper:340> And the gorillas <disfluency> are </disfluency> are coming back , are n't they *?* /?
<2370.15062448:2372.93057646:Anderson_Cooper:340> I mean they 're /-  <2372.12181487:2377.99848126:Jack_Hannah:341> Oh yeah seventeen percent increase /.

<2372.12181487:2377.99848126:Jack_Hannah:341> Uganda has about another three hundred /.
<2377.99848126:2382.52300611:Jack_Hannah:342> So you 're talking about a species that *T*-1 is very very vital as far as their numbers are concerned *-2 /.
<2382.52300611:2391.89200611:Jack_Hannah:343> You know if somebody got a cold up there like the veterinary project 's doing a great job up there right now uh you would have a disaster up there /.
<2382.52300611:2391.89200611:Jack_Hannah:343> so that 's why <disfluency> they be very careful if -- </disfluency> people ca n't have colds if they go up and visit the gorillas that type of thing *T*-1 /.
<2391.68981572:2396.74900611:Anderson_Cooper:344> Uh Jack it *EXP*-1 's always good *PRO* to see you /.

<2743.77460058:2751.55392912:David_Mattingly:391> and as you might be able *PRO*-1 to see behind me with all the flashing blue lights the investigation still underway /.
<2751.55392912:2768.89117558:David_Mattingly:392> We have also learned that at this hour investigators have questioned others as to where this young man was able *PRO*-1 to get a gun *T*-2 and how he was able *PRO*-3 to get it into the school *T*-4 *PRO*-5 questioning others *PRO*-6 to find out if others might have been somehow connected *-7 to this case /.
<2768.89117558:2776.38833441:David_Mattingly:393> But at this point most of the investigation is going on inside the building *PRO* collecting every possible piece of evidence that they can *T*-1 /.
<2776.38833441:2780.4937144:David_Mattingly:394> The suspect is in custody at a juvenile detention facility /.

<2790.90263716:2796.67991956:David_Mattingly:397> Uh they 're not willing at this point *PRO*-1 to put any sort of ~A ~B and ~C sequence together /.
<2796.67991956:2807.04326484:David_Mattingly:398> Uh there are some people who *T*-1 knew this young man who *T*-2 say that he was troubled /.
<2796.67991956:2807.04326484:David_Mattingly:398> but authorities will not confirm what *T*-3 was going through his mind or what *T*-4 was happening as this shooting occurred /.
<2807.04326484:2807.67408:David_Mattingly:399> Anderson /?
<2807.67408:2819.3814415:Anderson_Cooper:400> David we 've spoke uh <disfluency> i- </disfluency> in the last hour to a young man who *T*-1 knows uh this young man who *T*-2 's now in custody who *T*-3 said that he had been suspended *-4 previously for a year for *PRO*-4 stabbing an assitant principal <disfluency> wi- </disfluency> with a pen or a pencil /.
<2819.3814415:2820.74058857:Anderson_Cooper:401> Do you know anything more about that /?
<2821.57044089:2825.53294428:David_Mattingly:402> Uh authorities will not talk about that tonight /.
<2825.53294428:2831.5461308:David_Mattingly:403> Uh we 're hoping that they will shed more light on that tomorrow /.
<2825.53294428:2831.5461308:David_Mattingly:403> but we are hearing that story from multiple students /.
<2831.5461308:2849.01372283:David_Mattingly:404> We 're not sure if it 's all part of the rumors that *T*-1 go around after these type of incidents do occur /.
<2831.5461308:2849.01372283:David_Mattingly:404> but there seems *-2 to be some certain credibility in the widespread belief that <disfluency> this </disfluency> uh this student did have problems the year prior and had problems uh as he came back to this high school /.
<2849.01372283:2852.64653284:Anderson_Cooper:405> And David we 're looking at pictures *ICH*-1 now <disfluency> of </disfluency> of the suspect being put *-2 into a police car /.

<2854.26506627:2855.95828711:Anderson_Cooper:407> Is that blood on his shirt /?
<2856.99696275:2858.58593517:David_Mattingly:408> That is blood on his shirt /.
<2858.58593517:2870.64986936:David_Mattingly:409> Again he was treated *-1 for what *T*-2 looked like a gunshot wound to his hand *PRO* suggesting that he might have been wounded *-3 himself during whatever struggle that *T*-4 occurred after these shootings /.
<2870.64986936:2880.06672362:David_Mattingly:410> Authorities tell us that he had been subdued *-1 by the time 0 the first responders arrived here *T*-2 so that he was subdued *-3 by staff here at the school /.
<2880.06672362:2885.69878892:David_Mattingly:411> After all that *T*-1 happened the school was in lockdown /.
<2880.06672362:2885.69878892:David_Mattingly:411> the students were locked *-2 in their classes for about two hours /.
<2885.69878892:2890.82086817:David_Mattingly:412> They were released *-1 uh to some very anxious parents here outside the school grounds /.
<2890.82086817:2901.03155573:David_Mattingly:413> The school is going *-1 to be closed *-2 for the rest of the week Anderson /.
<2890.82086817:2901.03155573:David_Mattingly:413> There will be counseling here going on for anyone who *T*-1 needs it /.
<2890.82086817:2901.03155573:David_Mattingly:413> and that goes for not just the students but the staff here as well /.
<2900.62717494:2902.29220166:Anderson_Cooper:414> All right David thanks good reporting /.
<2902.29220166:2907.41909156:Anderson_Cooper:415> As David it is an active investigation and crime scene as you can see *?* very much uh still an active crime scene /.
<2907.41909156:2918.34667248:Anderson_Cooper:416> Uh if we had *-1 to pick a single thing 0 *T*-3 to underscore how completely life has changed in this country since nine eleven *T*-2 it might be the fact that there are now arguments serious ones not only against but also for torture /.
<2918.34667248:2921.62903059:Anderson_Cooper:417> *PRO* Never was a debate about this subject before /.
<2918.34667248:2921.62903059:Anderson_Cooper:417> now there certainly is *?* /.
<2921.62903059:2923.87254821:Anderson_Cooper:418> ~CNN 's Tom Forman has been investigating /.
<2923.87254821:2936.44337915:Tom_Forman:419> If you could save the life of a soldier rescue the hostage children stop the next terrorist bomb by *PRO* torturing a prisoner for information would you do it /?
<2936.44337915:2938.93096536:Spider_Marks:420> I 'd stick a knife in somebody 's thigh in a heartbeat /.
<2938.93096536:2946.67479657:Tom_Forman:421> Retired general Spider Marks a ~CNN consultant worked for ~US army intelligence *PRO*-1 teaching interrogation techniques /.
<2946.67479657:2952.50644995:Spider_Marks:422> The kind of enemies 0 we 're fighting *T*-1 have no sense of right or wrong /.
<2952.50644995:2955.32783768:Spider_Marks:423> They will go to any depths *PRO*-1 to achieve their ends /.
<2955.32783768:2956.63245392:Tom_Forman:424> Do we have *-1 to go with them /?
<2955.42221463:2956.51746026:Spider_Marks:425> <disfluency> We need to w- -- </disfluency> <2956.51746026:2960.96853545:Spider_Marks:426> we do n't need *-1 to go with them /.
<2956.51746026:2960.96853545:Spider_Marks:426> we need *-2 to preclude them from *PRO*-3 going there /.
<2960.96853545:2965.83130562:Spider_Marks:427> And that might include some use of torture in order *PRO* to prevent it /.
<2965.83130562:2973.06912579:Tom_Forman:428> Polls have shown that more than sixty percent of Americans think 0 it can sometimes be justified *-1 /.
<2973.06912579:2974.40597579:Tom_Forman:429> But here 's the catch /.
<2974.40597579:2981.85316657:Tom_Forman:430> Experts including General Marks are convinced *-1 0 with the vast majority of prisoners it just does n't work /.
<2981.85316657:2986.31294992:Mark_Jacobson:431> It does not give you credible accurate timely inactionable intelligence /.
<2986.31294992:2990.62452847:Tom_Forman:432> Mark Jacobson a former defense department official outlines the troubles /.
<2990.62452847:2997.94018452:Tom_Forman:433> <speaker=Mark_Jacobson>} You need *-1 to know 0 a prisoner has critical information /.
<2990.62452847:2997.94018452:Tom_Forman:433> the prisoner must be succeptable to torture /.
<2990.62452847:2997.94018452:Tom_Forman:433> and oh by the way <2997.94018452:3004.38805256:Mark_Jacobson:434> when people are tortured *-2 *T*-3 , when people endure physical pain *T*-4 they 're going *-5 to seek *PRO*-6 to stop that as quickly as possible /.
<3004.38805256:3008.59047631:Mark_Jacobson:435> If I torture you you 're going *-1 to tell me exactly what I expect *-2 to hear *T*-3 /.
<3008.59047631:3015.75651395:Tom_Forman:436> The White House *PRO*-2 under fire over reports of secret ~CIA prisons overseas says 0 torture is not allowed *-1 /.
<3015.75651395:3016.80377059:Tom_Forman:437> But /-
<3016.80377059:3020.91214622:speaker2:438> We are going *-1 to do what *T*-2 is necessary *PRO* to protect the American people /.

<3026.04065946:3027.57637686:speaker2:440> Uh we have made that very clear /.
<3027.57637686:3035.25134663:Tom_Forman:441> The definition of torture is infliction of severe physical pain as a means of punishment or coersion /.
<3035.25134663:3039.2478559:Tom_Forman:442> Legal authorities around the world are arguing over what that means *T*-1 /.
<3039.2478559:3047.94326832:Tom_Forman:443> Some insist 0 the abuses at that Iraqi prison *ICH*-1 easily qualify along with sleep deprivation humiliation extreme fear /.
<3047.94326832:3051.8455955:Tom_Forman:444> Others say 0 those things do n't even come close /.
<3051.8455955:3057.36565621:Tom_Forman:445> The global jury is still out /.
<3051.8455955:3057.36565621:Tom_Forman:445> and even experts are pondering a paradox /.
<3057.36565621:3065.17808092:Tom_Forman:446> So in your experience and in your view torture as a policy should be against the law /.
<3065.17808092:3066.25976829:speaker7:447> True /.
<3066.25976829:3070.29070828:Tom_Forman:448> And yet we might still have *-1 to use it /.

<3071.51922861:3078.12242492:Tom_Forman:450> And *PRO* wondering which truth about torture *T*-1 will stand in a dangerous world /.
<3078.12242492:3081.21033823:Tom_Forman:451> Tom Forman ~CNN Washington /.
<3081.21033823:3084.80038625:Anderson_Cooper:452> Well it *EXP*-1 's interesting 0 President Bush has said categorically 0 we do n't torture /.
<3084.80038625:3087.18029105:Anderson_Cooper:453> He also says 0 we 'll do whatever *T*-1 is necessary /.
<3087.18029105:3088.74929105:Anderson_Cooper:454> So what exactly does that mean *T*-1 /?
<3088.74929105:3092.15386308:Anderson_Cooper:455> We asked a couple law professors earlier this evening *PRO*-1 to discuss the issue with us /.
<3092.15386308:3098.15329274:Anderson_Cooper:456> John Yoo of University of California Berkeley who *T*-1 served in the justice department from two thousand and one to two thousand and three /.
<3098.15329274:3100.89681675:Anderson_Cooper:457> He 's also a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute /.
<3100.89681675:3103.86481927:Anderson_Cooper:458> Also joining us Alan Dershowitz professor of law at Harvard <3103.86481927:3108.76829611:Anderson_Cooper:459> the author of a great many books including The Case for Peace How the Arab Israeli Conflict can be Resolved *-1 *T*-2 /.
<3108.76829611:3112.33286814:Anderson_Cooper:460> Also involved *-2 in discussion was *T*-1 Bill Goodman at the Center for Contitutional Rights /.
<3112.33286814:3113.90986814:Anderson_Cooper:461> Here 's some of the conversation /.
<3113.90986814:3118.87086814:Anderson_Cooper:462> Professor Dershowitz under what circumstances do you think 0 torture is justified *-2 *T*-1 /?
<3118.87086814:3122.56996418:Alan_Dershowitz:463> Torture is never justified *-1 /.
<3118.87086814:3122.56996418:Alan_Dershowitz:463> and I hope 0 we never have *-2 to use it in the United States /.
<3122.56996418:3132.21963141:Alan_Dershowitz:464> But if we ever had a ticking bomb terrorist who *T*-1 could under torture reveal the location of a bomb that *T*-2 would destroy hundreds of thousands of people I guarantee you 0 we would use it /.
<3132.21963141:3134.53839383:Alan_Dershowitz:465> That 's an empirical judgement not a normative one /.
<3134.53839383:3138.15539383:Alan_Dershowitz:466> And if we would use it then we have *-1 to use it only with accountability /.
<3138.15539383:3148.73239383:Alan_Dershowitz:467> And that means that the president of the United States or the vice president or the secretary of defense or the chief justice has *-1 to specifically authorize precisely the kind of extreme measures that *T*-2 are permitted *-3 to be used *-4 /.
<3148.73239383:3152.26139383:Alan_Dershowitz:468> No extreme measures without accountability that has *-1 to be the rule /.
<3152.26139383:3154.35839383:Anderson_Cooper:469> Bill Goodman you believe 0 that 's uh a slippery slope /.
<3154.35839383:3156.17596671:Bill_Goodman:470> I think 0 it 's a very slippery slope /.
<3156.17596671:3168.967302:Bill_Goodman:471> <disfluency> I once -- </disfluency> I think 0 once you start *-1 to say well under these circumstances empirically you 're going *-2 to *?* and you have *-3 to provide these kinds of measures if you do it then you 're basically <unintelligible> that <disfluency> i- </disfluency> under certain circumstances it can happen <3168.967302:3173.25773082:Bill_Goodman:472> It should happen and then it 's going *-4 happen under more than those exceptional circumstances /.

<52.5695029486:56.9958138481:Larry_King:8> <disfluency> When did Linda Hamilton first -- </disfluency> When was that first day problem *T*-1 /?
<56.9787686833:63.8426911547:Linda_Hamilton:9> Well *PRO*-1 looking back I feel that a lot of my life there was a problem /.
<62.6597691068:63.8426911547:Larry_King:10> As a teenager you mean *T*-1 /?
<63.8426911547:74.8717080186:Linda_Hamilton:11> As a teenager even as a younger girl I had some depression /.  <63.8426911547:74.8717080186:Linda_Hamilton:11> but no one really noticed 0 it was depression /.
<63.8426911547:74.8717080186:Linda_Hamilton:11> nor did I know in those days that that 's what it was *T*-1 /.

<74.8717080186:87.8954078841:Linda_Hamilton:12> But I did feel different from other people /.
<74.8717080186:87.8954078841:Linda_Hamilton:12> Um I was in hiding a lot of my childhood although I had a wonderful upbringing and a very normal middle class upbringing /.  <88.077260755:88.7624593754:Larry_King:13> Where 'd you grow up *T*-1 /?

<88.7624593754:90.2060846727:Linda_Hamilton:14> In Maryland on the Chesapeake Bay /.
<90.2060846727:91.1951844646:Larry_King:15> Ah North West /.
<91.1951844646:92.0326178676:Linda_Hamilton:16> Salisbury Maryland /.
<92.0326178676:93.0090235333:Larry_King:17> What 'd your father do *T*-1 /?
<93.0090235333:93.9071803313:Linda_Hamilton:18> My father was a doctor /.
<93.9071803313:94.6113254087:Larry_King:19> Oh /.
<94.6113254087:95.8851904506:Linda_Hamilton:20> who *T*-1 died when I was five *T*-2 /.
<95.8851904506:96.7346548538:Larry_King:21> Oh /.
<95.8851904506:96.7346548538:Linda_Hamilton:22> But he was also diagnosed *-1 with bipolar disorder /.
<95.8851904506:96.7346548538:Linda_Hamilton:22> In those days they called it *PRO*-1 manic depression /.
<96.7346548538:109.473684202:Linda_Hamilton:23> But he had extreme mood swings and died in a car crash when I was five *T*-1 /.
<109.473684202:116.023815339:Linda_Hamilton:24> And so it *EXP*-2 's hard *PRO* to separate you know what *T*-1 was the reality for me /.
<109.473684202:116.023815339:Linda_Hamilton:24> Was it loss of father that *T*-1 drove me into depression /?
<116.023815339:121.558386197:Linda_Hamilton:25> And you know we can all look around and find situations that *T*-1 fuel a certain feeling in our lives /.
<121.558386197:126.09407329:Linda_Hamilton:26> But I realize now *PRO*-1 looking back over my life that I was really just in hiding <126.09407329:129.623324583:Linda_Hamilton:27> um comforted myself with food , I was a compulsive eater /.
<129.412613433:130.679115904:Larry_King:28> Overweight /?
<130.679115904:135.623491349:Linda_Hamilton:29> By the time 0 I was in high school *T*-1 I was a hundred and seventy pounds /.
<135.623491349:139.596915781:Linda_Hamilton:30> and I was just very alone in life /.
<139.596915781:140.828340759:Larry_King:31> Did you get uh moody a lot /?
<140.828340759:153.881976027:Linda_Hamilton:32> I was moody /.
<140.828340759:153.881976027:Linda_Hamilton:32> but I think 0 it was only when I got out of my childhood home and started *-1 having the freedom *PRO* to be the wild girl and express all that *T*-2 was inside of me *T*-3 that I really got into trouble *T*-4 /.
<153.881976027:155.010332278:Larry_King:33> Were you a wild girl /?
<155.010332278:163.729397095:Linda_Hamilton:34> I was a wild girl /.
<155.010332278:163.729397095:Linda_Hamilton:34> I was a real alcoholic for the longest time /.
<155.010332278:163.729397095:Linda_Hamilton:34> I messed with drugs /.
<155.010332278:163.729397095:Linda_Hamilton:34> I mean I 've come through a lot of things /.
<163.729397095:164.833691346:Larry_King:35> Did you go to college /?
<164.833691346:178.245604117:Linda_Hamilton:36> I was a chaotic mess even at the age of twenty two /.
<164.833691346:178.245604117:Linda_Hamilton:36> I think 0 that *ICH*-1 was probably the lowest of the low for me when I was twenty two years old and went into a therapist 's chair with such a broken heart <178.245604117:190.195568439:Linda_Hamilton:37> such a broken life you know and a friend that *T*-2 had recently died just sort of pushed me over the edge *T*-3 /.
<178.245604117:190.195568439:Linda_Hamilton:37> and you know it 's the best thing 0 I ever did *T*-3 /.
<164.833691346:178.245604117:Linda_Hamilton:37> I sought help for twenty years /.
<164.833691346:178.245604117:Linda_Hamilton:37> I worked tirelessly <190.195568439:193.197539831:Linda_Hamilton:38> *PRO*-1 to conquer my behaviors /.
<193.197539831:194.105535513:Larry_King:39> You were in therapy for twenty years /?
<194.105535513:204.536632371:Linda_Hamilton:40> For twenty years different therapies different body work acupuncture /.
<194.105535513:204.536632371:Linda_Hamilton:40> I 've worked with psychiatrists therapists healers /.
<204.536632371:222.517469994:Linda_Hamilton:41> No I mean I am a seeker /.
<204.536632371:222.517469994:Linda_Hamilton:41> so I worked really hard *PRO*-1 to kind of curtail those behaviors /.
<204.536632371:222.517469994:Linda_Hamilton:41> but I could not be in charge *RNR*-2 or in control *RNR*-2 of my behavior until I went on medicine when I got the proper diagnosis *T*-3 /.
<204.536632371:222.517469994:Linda_Hamilton:41> and then I was able *ICH*-4 for the first time in my life *PRO*-5 to step back /.
<222.517469994:223.312558065:Larry_King:42> Did you go to college /?
<223.312558065:224.795036873:Linda_Hamilton:43> I went to college for two years /.
<224.795036873:225.495311201:Larry_King:44> What school /?
<225.495311201:228.733734377:Linda_Hamilton:45> Ah I went to Washington College in Chestertown Maryland /.
<228.733734377:229.771337099:Larry_King:46> Did you have problems there /?
<229.771337099:241.890688755:Linda_Hamilton:47> Um I was an outsider even then /.
<229.771337099:241.890688755:Linda_Hamilton:47> I lived off campus /.
<229.771337099:241.890688755:Linda_Hamilton:47> *PRO* never really felt like I belonged in the college drama department /.
<229.771337099:241.890688755:Linda_Hamilton:47> I was always sort of separate /.
<241.890688755:252.683761868:Linda_Hamilton:48> Um and then when I realized that my real passion was for acting *T*-1 I took the rest of my money and my college fund and moved to New York and studied and maintained rather well in New York /.
<252.683761868:257.183071764:Linda_Hamilton:49> When I got to Los Angeles at the age of twenty two *T*-1 all hell broke loose /.  <257.183071764:264.459326427:Larry_King:50> Even though you got acclaim and did well /.
<257.183071764:264.459326427:Larry_King:50> so how do you explain *T*-1 /?

<257.183071764:264.459326427:Larry_King:50> That 's a dichotomy /.
<264.459326427:267.042770583:Linda_Hamilton:51> I mean some of us are luckier than others /.
<267.042770583:268.31533592:Larry_King:52> What was your break *T*-1 /?
<268.31533592:292.250416249:Linda_Hamilton:53> Even though I say you know that I was under the you know terrible burden of mental illness I think 0 there was a real survivor streak in me and a real fighter and a real fierceness /.

<268.31533592:292.250416249:Linda_Hamilton:53> and maybe that 's what people saw *T*-1 and hired me for *T*-1 you know cause I was really just going *-2 to keep *-3 pushing until I got free of all of the things that *T*-4 were bothering me /.
<292.250416249:293.433338297:Larry_King:54> What was your first break in ~LA *T*-1 /?
<293.433338297:305.71242186:Linda_Hamilton:55> My first break was a movie for television that I did *T*-1 with Mickey Roarke /.  <293.433338297:305.71242186:Linda_Hamilton:55> Mickey Roarke was just breaking *PRO*-1 big at the time /.
<293.433338297:305.71242186:Linda_Hamilton:55> and I replaced an actress actually who *T*-2 was just in over her head /.
<305.71242186:317.610267775:Linda_Hamilton:56> Mickey I think 0 *?* was an intimidating presence /.
<305.71242186:317.610267775:Linda_Hamilton:56> and they had hired a girl who *T*-1 had done very little had done a lot of stage work but just was n't prepared *PRO*-2 to come to work and face Mickey Roarke /.

<317.610267775:322.152017735:Linda_Hamilton:57> <disfluency> He played -- </disfluency> uh *PRO* remember the Greta Rideout and John Rideout story the first woman who *T*-1 sued her husband for rape /?

<317.610267775:322.152017735:Linda_Hamilton:57> I played her in a film with Mickey /.
<326.584636101:334.127504862:Larry_King:58> When you hit it *PRO*-1 big with Terminator and everything was going fantastic for you *T*-2 you were still bipolar , *PRO* right /?

<334.127504862:341.942634211:Linda_Hamilton:59> Well very much /.

<334.127504862:341.942634211:Linda_Hamilton:59> and somehow the bigger the life the bigger the illness /.
<334.127504862:341.942634211:Linda_Hamilton:59> It *ICH*-2 just kept *-1 growing <341.942634211:350.370681447:Linda_Hamilton:60> the illness my behavior /.
<341.942634211:350.370681447:Linda_Hamilton:60> so you 'd get into a certain pattern of behavior /.
<341.942634211:350.370681447:Linda_Hamilton:60> and now you 're dealing with a pattern of behavior as well as an emotional illness /.
<350.370681447:351.499132431:Larry_King:61> So this did n't help it /?
<351.499132431:362.269253783:Linda_Hamilton:62> No no I think 0 it gave me a wonderful arena in which *PRO* to act out all my rage *T*-1 /.
<351.499132431:362.269253783:Linda_Hamilton:62> I 'd be like you 're really good at *PRO* being mad /.
<362.269253783:374.565409697:Linda_Hamilton:63> But uh for success it 's all about how you feel about yourself inside *T*-1 /.

<362.269253783:374.565409697:Linda_Hamilton:63> and inside I was just a scared and out of control hurt little girl for most of my life /.
<375.666125906:376.915739483:Larry_King:64> Did marriages help /?
<376.915739483:378.268611251:Linda_Hamilton:65> No um /.
<378.268611251:379.312276839:Larry_King:66> You had two /?
<379.385425812:387.540265137:Linda_Hamilton:67> As a matter of fact I would say /-

<379.385425812:387.540265137:Linda_Hamilton:67> I have a child with each /.
<387.540265137:400.6907168:Linda_Hamilton:68> I would like *PRO*-1 to take this moment *PRO*-2 to say that I was n't married *-3 to Peter Horton which *ICH*-5 *T*-4 is sort of all over the websites that I 've been married *-6 three times so I look like /-
<387.540265137:400.6907168:Linda_Hamilton:68> But that 's false information /.
<387.540265137:400.6907168:Linda_Hamilton:68> I was never married *-1 to Peter Horton /.
<400.035118525:401.321298764:Larry_King:69> How old are the children *T*-1 /?
<401.321298764:405.74575688:Linda_Hamilton:70> Um how old are the children *T*-1 /?
<401.321298764:405.74575688:Linda_Hamilton:70> My son is sixteen /.
<401.321298764:405.74575688:Linda_Hamilton:70> and my daughter is twelve /.
<405.74575688:406.742637993:Larry_King:71> And how are they doing *T*-1 /?

<409.327124204:414.972505288:Linda_Hamilton:74> but boy they have someone that *T*-1 's watching them all the time for any signs /.
<414.972505288:422.218483066:Linda_Hamilton:75> We have a household where we talk about our feelings and make *PRO* *EXP*-1 sure that no one is afraid *PRO*-2 to speak of what *T*-3 's going on *T*-4 /.
<422.218483066:435.381818321:Linda_Hamilton:76> I just find it *EXP*-1 strange that in this world everyone is so easy *PRO*-2 to talk about the superficial you know and how people look *T*-3 and what they do *T*-4 to their faces but no one is really having the dialog of what *T*-5 's going on inside of them /.
<435.381818321:439.523608571:Linda_Hamilton:77> And I think that I hid my symptoms pretty well for most of my life /.
<439.523608571:442.131493656:Linda_Hamilton:78> But there 's still a raging war going on /.

<442.131493656:448.522607291:Larry_King:79> We 'll ask Linda when it got its worst *T*-1 , how bad it got *T*-2 , what were some of the concepts 0 she had *-3 to go through *T*-4 *T*-5 /.

<679.178188213:683.289474668:Larry_King:81> Were you comfortable *ICH*-1 because of the illness *PRO*-2 being frantic /?
<683.289474668:687.340321924:Linda_Hamilton:82> Actually I think 0 that was a pretty ordinary place 0 for me to go to *T*-1 /.
<687.340321924:690.457393043:Larry_King:83> So it *EXP*-1 was n't hard for you to go nuts , *PRO* right /?
<687.655838455:690.463798127:Linda_Hamilton:84> I was frantic inside /.
<687.655838455:690.463798127:Linda_Hamilton:84> No /.
<690.463798127:695.351320928:Linda_Hamilton:85> And *PRO* to just sort of let it get out there in a way that was you know safe /.  <695.351320928:701.924131086:Larry_King:86> At its height how bad was it *T*-1 /?

<695.351320928:701.924131086:Larry_King:86> What would you hallucinate *T*-1 /?
<701.924131086:722.468886556:Linda_Hamilton:87> Um it was not terrible hallucinations /.
<701.924131086:722.468886556:Linda_Hamilton:87> <disfluency> The biggest low for me </disfluency> at its height the biggest low was uh the birth of my second child and a post-partem depression that *T*-1 followed which *T*-2 was very much like a psychosis /.
<701.924131086:722.468886556:Linda_Hamilton:87> I could n't leave the house without *PRO*-1 thinking that they were going *-2 to be chopped *-3 into bloody pieces /.
<722.468886556:735.074248649:Linda_Hamilton:88> I mean I had visions /.

<722.468886556:735.074248649:Linda_Hamilton:88> I could n't leave my house without *PRO* feeling /-
<722.468886556:735.074248649:Linda_Hamilton:88> you know at this point I had gone through thirteen nannies or something /.
<722.468886556:735.074248649:Linda_Hamilton:88> and I just did not feel that my kids were going *-1 to be OK if I was not in the house *PRO*-2 protecting them /.
<734.117647059:737.792407142:Larry_King:89> Did you ever think 0 you would harm them /?
<734.117647059:737.792407142:Larry_King:89> That happens sometimes /.
<737.792407142:746.802679004:Linda_Hamilton:90> Um no I have not ever felt that /.
<737.792407142:746.802679004:Linda_Hamilton:90> but I know people that *T*-1 have *?* /.
<737.792407142:746.802679004:Linda_Hamilton:90> and I praise God that that did n't happen to me /.
<746.802679004:748.620796116:Larry_King:91> Did you have hallucinations too /?
<748.620796116:763.032513427:Linda_Hamilton:92> Not hallucinations as you would call them *PRO*-2 *?* but cyclical thoughts that *T*-1 repeated terrible sleep disturbances /.
<748.620796116:763.032513427:Linda_Hamilton:92> Months *ICH*-1 would go by where I would n't get a decent night 's sleep *T*-2 , where it would literally feel like I could n't sleep *T*-3 /.
<748.620796116:763.032513427:Linda_Hamilton:92> I had anxiety attacks /.
<763.032513427:764.603458916:Larry_King:93> How did your husbands deal with this *T*-1 /?
<764.143985953:790.717528797:Linda_Hamilton:94> Well um I was a challenge /.
<764.143985953:790.717528797:Linda_Hamilton:94> I think 0 Jim said to me once I like who I leave *T*-1 in the morning but I do n't always know who I 'm going *-3 to come home to *T*-2 at night because depending on what *T*-4 had happened during the day if something had distressed me , a small thing had become a huge thing and I could n't let it go and I could n't forgive and I could n't get out of myself and I just could n't let *PRO* go /.
<790.272168569:791.497530681:Larry_King:95> He directed you , did he not *?* /?

<282.62243134:297.007121314:Senator_Schumer:31> and this is sort of interesting /.
<282.62243134:297.007121314:Senator_Schumer:31> we both agree that the nominee should state their judicial philosophy give us some idea of how he or if it were *PRO*-1 to be a she thinks on these issues *T*-2 /.
<297.007121314:303.560121314:Senator_Schumer:32> I think 0 the days of the stealth nominee which Harriet Myers clearly was *T*-1 is over /.
<303.560121314:317.369121314:Senator_Schumer:33> You know Supreme Court Justices have tremendous tremendous power over every one of our lives /.
<303.560121314:317.369121314:Senator_Schumer:33> and the only time 0 you really get *PRO*-1 to question them see what they think *T*-2 *T*-3 is when the Senate has its confirmation process *T*-4 /.
<317.369121314:324.378121314:Senator_Schumer:34> We agree that that ought *-1 to happen /.
<317.369121314:324.378121314:Senator_Schumer:34> it ought *-2 to happen in a dignified way /.
<317.369121314:324.378121314:Senator_Schumer:34> it ought *-3 to happen in thoughtful way /.
<317.369121314:324.378121314:Senator_Schumer:34> but it certainly ought *-4 to happen /.
<324.378121314:328.603121314:Larry_King:35> He wo n't make the court if *PRO* approved *-1 until January , *PRO* right /?
<328.603121314:338.996121314:Senator_Schumer:36> Well I think 0 that 's true /.
<328.603121314:338.996121314:Senator_Schumer:36> And you know that 's one thing that *T*-1 does worry me /.
<328.603121314:338.996121314:Senator_Schumer:36> because of the importance of this nomination there should n't be a rush through the procedure /.
<338.996121314:359.281906487:Senator_Schumer:37> Some were saying *PRO* let 's get this done *-1 very quickly /.
<338.996121314:359.281906487:Senator_Schumer:37> That does a disservice /.
<338.996121314:359.281906487:Senator_Schumer:37> Judge Alito is fifty - five years old /.
<338.996121314:359.281906487:Senator_Schumer:37> He 's likely *PRO*-1 to be on the court for several decades *PRO*-2 having a huge effect not only on us but on our children maybe our grandchildren /.
<338.996121314:359.281906487:Senator_Schumer:37> and we ought *-3 to be careful and thoughtful above all /.
<338.996121314:359.281906487:Senator_Schumer:37> No rush here /.
<338.996121314:359.281906487:Senator_Schumer:37> *PRO* should n't be *?* /.
<359.281906487:373.002906487:Larry_King:38> David Gergen on this program Bill Clinton said that often judges disappoint the presidents who *T*-1 appoint them because it 's the first time in their life 0 they have a job where they 're not appealed *-2 *T*-3 *T*-4 and they also see things differently /.
<373.002906487:381.22235973:David_Gergen:39> Ah that 's true /.
<373.002906487:381.22235973:David_Gergen:39> I do not think 0 that 's the case in this instance because Judge Alito does have a long record /.
<381.22235973:392.87935973:David_Gergen:40> He 's got fifteen years on the court of appeals /.
<381.22235973:392.87935973:David_Gergen:40> uh and the one thing 0 we do know *T*-1 about him is that he 's had some forty - one dissents on that court almost always to the right of a court that *T*-2 has been fairly liberal /.
<392.87935973:409.90435973:David_Gergen:41> Uh and <disfluency> that there </disfluency> <disfluency> so there 's -- </disfluency> <disfluency> I think 0 he 's got -- </disfluency> I think 0 he has a consistent philosophy /.
<392.87935973:409.90435973:David_Gergen:41> Larry <disfluency> my judgment </disfluency> hmm the President deserves *PRO*-1 to be congratulated *-2 for *PRO*-3 now putting forward someone *ICH*-4 again who *T*-5 has experience and who *T*-6 is talented *-7 /.
<392.87935973:409.90435973:David_Gergen:41> There 's no question about that /.
<392.87935973:409.90435973:David_Gergen:41> He appears *-1 to be quite genial /.
<392.87935973:409.90435973:David_Gergen:41> I 'm sure 0 he 'll do pretty well in the hearings /.
<409.90435973:424.126812131:David_Gergen:42> My sense is that this is ultimately going *-1 to come down to the question <disfluency> is the congress or </disfluency> is the senate going *-2 to confirm someone who *T*-4 is going *-5 to be a reliable conservative and probably be voting consistently with Scalia and Thomas or will the Democrats be able *PRO*-6 to block that /?
<424.126812131:432.495812131:David_Gergen:43> <disfluency> And that 's going *-1 to be -- </disfluency> <disfluency> that 's going *-2 to be -- </disfluency> and that 's a very big important battle over the judicial philosophy that *T*-3 ought *-4 to guide the court /.
<432.495812131:438.656812131:Larry_King:44> Senator Brownbeck could he be a reliable conservative and still vote *PRO*-1 to uphold Roe vs. Wade /?
<438.656812131:452.121812131:Senator_Brownbeck:45> Well I think 0 one could probably look at that /.
<438.656812131:452.121812131:Senator_Brownbeck:45> but I think 0 that 's an unlikely way 0 *PRO* to consider it *T*-1 /.
<438.656812131:452.121812131:Senator_Brownbeck:45> Roe vs. Wade the right to an abortion that *T*-1 's read *-2 into the constitution is not in the constitution /.
<452.121812131:470.578812131:Senator_Brownbeck:46> Uh and there 's a number of commentators from the left and right that *T*-1 agree that this is not in the constitution /.
<452.121812131:470.578812131:Senator_Brownbeck:46> It should be debated *-1 /.
<452.121812131:470.578812131:Senator_Brownbeck:46> It should be dealt with *-1 by legislators across the country /.
<452.121812131:470.578812131:Senator_Brownbeck:46> So I think 0 he could read it that way /.
<452.121812131:470.578812131:Senator_Brownbeck:46> but it seems to me *PRO*-1 unlikely on somebody that *T*-2 would be more of a strict constructionist on the constitution /.

<470.578812131:475.955812131:Larry_King:47> But he could uphold just on precedent , could he not *?* /?
<470.578812131:475.955812131:Larry_King:47> because he has said in the past that he favors precedent /.
<475.955812131:484.026264532:Senator_Brownbeck:48> I think 0 almost every judge and justice favors precedent the role of <uncertain> starry decises </uncertain> that once a law is settled *-1 it 's settled *-2 /.
<484.026264532:492.292646167:Senator_Brownbeck:49> You know you look in our history /.
<484.026264532:492.292646167:Senator_Brownbeck:49> we 've had a number of cases in the supreme court that *T*-1 have been overturned *-2 by later courts /.
<484.026264532:492.292646167:Senator_Brownbeck:49> and thank goodness 0 they did /.
<492.292646167:504.221646167:Senator_Brownbeck:50> Brown versus Board of Education is in my home state of Kansas /.
<492.292646167:504.221646167:Senator_Brownbeck:50> It overruled earlier laws that *T*-1 said 0 segregation was OK /.
<492.292646167:504.221646167:Senator_Brownbeck:50> <disfluency> Thankfully </disfluency> thankfully the court overturned those prior decisions /.
<504.221646167:506.806646167:Larry_King:51> Chuck Schumer do you expect a battle /?
<506.806646167:513.207646167:Senator_Schumer:52> Well honestly *PRO* let me just say 0 I would have hoped that we could have avoided a battle /.
<507.346251053:510.099251053:Larry_King:53> Do you honestly expect it /?
<513.220251053:531.013251053:Senator_Schumer:54> I would have hoped that the President would choose a real consensus nominee who *T*-1 would have much broader support /.
<513.220251053:531.013251053:Senator_Schumer:54> but I think 0 what *T*-2 happened here is 0 not a single senator for instance said that uh Harriet Myers ' nomination should be withdrawn *-3 /.
<513.220251053:531.013251053:Senator_Schumer:54> Sam may have been on the edge /.
<513.220251053:531.013251053:Senator_Schumer:54> but I do n't think 0 he ever said it /.
<531.013251053:536.852060657:Senator_Schumer:55> It was only these very extreme groups that *T*-1 said it /.
<531.013251053:536.852060657:Senator_Schumer:55> and the President went along with them /.
<536.852060657:543.877060657:Senator_Schumer:56> And you know I got *-1 to tell you this Larry /.
<536.852060657:543.877060657:Senator_Schumer:56> I ca n't tell you what *T*-2 will happen with Judge Alito /.
<536.852060657:543.877060657:Senator_Schumer:56> I think 0 it 's very close as David Gergen said *?* /.
<543.877060657:558.198060657:Senator_Schumer:57> But any President who *T*-1 seeks *PRO*-2 to govern whether it 's court appointments or anything else from the extremes Democrats from the far left extreme Republicans from the far right extreme it does n't serve the country well /.
<543.877060657:558.198060657:Senator_Schumer:57> and it ends up *PRO*-3 not serving themselves well /.
<558.198060657:561.063060657:Larry_King:58> David Gergen you have a prediction /.
<558.198060657:561.063060657:Larry_King:58> or too early *PRO* to tell /?
<561.063060657:574.57641786:David_Gergen:59> Too early *PRO* to tell /.
<561.063060657:574.57641786:David_Gergen:59> *PRO* Watch what some of the more moderate Democrats do *T*-1 /.
<561.063060657:574.57641786:David_Gergen:59> *PRO* Watch what Olympia Snow Susan Colins and Lincoln Chaffey do *T*-1 on the Republican side /.
<561.063060657:574.57641786:David_Gergen:59> Those are going *-1 to be the swing votes /.
<561.063060657:574.57641786:David_Gergen:59> and it 's just way too early *PRO* to tell /.
<574.57641786:587.77741786:David_Gergen:60> <disfluency> I think 0 it 's -- </disfluency> uh <disfluency> I think -- </disfluency> I think 0 he 's reliably conservative /.
<574.57641786:587.77741786:David_Gergen:60> I think 0 the issue becomes as the country gets *PRO*-1 to know what some of the individual decisions are *T*-2 whether the country is going *-3 to welcome this or not /.
<574.57641786:587.77741786:David_Gergen:60> I think 0 it 's just too early *PRO* to tell /.

<66.6025104603:71.8117154812:Bob_Woodward:10> Um yes ah apparently /.
<66.6025104603:71.8117154812:Bob_Woodward:10> Ah again I 'm not sure 0 there 's any crime in all of this /.
<71.8242677824:84.8786610879:Bob_Woodward:11> Um the special prosecutor 's been working eighteen months /.
<71.8242677824:84.8786610879:Bob_Woodward:11> Uh eighteen months into Watergate we knew about the tapes /.
<71.8242677824:84.8786610879:Bob_Woodward:11> people were in jail /.
<71.8242677824:84.8786610879:Bob_Woodward:11> people had pled *PRO*-1 guilty /.
<71.8242677824:84.8786610879:Bob_Woodward:11> in other words there was a solid evidentary trail /.
<85.0041841004:89.0836820084:speaker1:12> Well but <disfluency> crime or not </disfluency> crime or not it looks like a bit of political dirty work /.
<85.0292887029:86.3347280335:Bob_Woodward:13> I do n't see it here /.
<89.1589958159:93.2008368201:Bob_Woodward:14> Well <disfluency> n- </disfluency> I mean <disfluency> it it </disfluency> it may just be politics as usual /.
<93.2133891213:115.820083682:Bob_Woodward:15> <disfluency> W- </disfluency> <disfluency> I </disfluency> I mean Rove 's ah defenders say *PRO* look , the evidence is /-
<93.2133891213:115.820083682:Bob_Woodward:15> <disfluency> And the ev- -- </disfluency> <disfluency> and </disfluency> and the evidence is ah that he was saying 0 ah um Joe Wilson who *T*-1 was uh criticizing the administration on weapons of mass destruction really had an axe 0 *PRO* to grind *T*-2 and got his job because his wife had worked at the ~CIA and recommended him /.
<115.845188285:124.556485356:Bob_Woodward:16> So <disfluency> th- </disfluency> there 's fuzziness to this /.
<115.845188285:124.556485356:Bob_Woodward:16> Now it may turn out *-1 to be ah worse than Watergate /.
<115.845188285:124.556485356:Bob_Woodward:16> ah but ah it does n't look that way now /.
<124.594142259:134.171548117:speaker1:17> All right I asked the New York Times editor Bill Keller ah this past week about whether the newspaper and Judy Miller were acting above the law after *PRO*-1 losing in the courts /.
<124.594142259:134.171548117:speaker1:17> Here 's what *ICH*-2 he had *T*-1 0 *PRO*-4 to say *T*-3 /.
<134.912133891:140.071129707:Bill_Keller:18> <disfluency> Th- </disfluency> the above the law thing <disfluency> is </disfluency> is a little gratuitous ah I think 0 *T*-1 /.
<140.083682008:146.648535565:Bill_Keller:19> Ah I mean the law presented Judy Miller with a choice she could betray her trust ah or she could go to jail /.
<146.673640167:152.736401674:Bill_Keller:20> and she took what I believe 0 *T*-1 is <disfluency> the </disfluency> the brave and honorable choice /.
<146.673640167:152.736401674:Bill_Keller:20> she went to jail /.
<152.861924686:155.158995816:Bill_Keller:21> <disfluency> We r- </disfluency> we ran out of law /.
<155.259414226:160.631799163:speaker1:22> Could you have been subpeonaed *-1 ah and threatened *-1 with jail during Watergate /.
<155.259414226:160.631799163:speaker1:22> or was the climate toward the press so much different then /?
<160.669456067:167.309623431:Bob_Woodward:23> Well I do n't know that it 's different /.
<160.669456067:167.309623431:Bob_Woodward:23> Ah assuredly <disfluency> we could 've -- </disfluency> Carl Berstein and I could 've been subpoenaed *-1 ah /.
<166.205020921:167.058577406:speaker1:24> Did you worry about it /?
<167.435146444:187.958158996:Bob_Woodward:25> Sure a little bit /.
<167.435146444:187.958158996:Bob_Woodward:25> but you know <disfluency> what </disfluency> what *T*-1 happened ah /.
<167.435146444:187.958158996:Bob_Woodward:25> There were so many *ICH*-1 specifics in our stories ah about money <disfluency> and </disfluency> and high level people in the White house and the Nixon campaign that the prosecutors could subpoena them and get them to talk which eventually they did *T*-2 /.
<167.435146444:187.958158996:Bob_Woodward:25> and there were Senate hearings when ah everyone testified in public *T*-3 /.
<188.008368201:192.163179916:Bob_Woodward:26> So <disfluency> you </disfluency> you had ah very very different circumstances /.
<192.188284519:201.476987448:Bob_Woodward:27> So you know I agree with the editor of the New York Times that ah this is <disfluency> a </disfluency> not a perfect case Judy Miller /.
<201.527196653:214.569037657:Bob_Woodward:28> but the idea of the government and special prosecutors monkeying around with the relationship that *ICH*-2 reporters have *T*-1 with sources ah <disfluency> is a -- </disfluency> is a very very bad thing /.
<214.581589958:223.317991632:Bob_Woodward:29> And you look at the Matt Cooper business /.
<214.581589958:223.317991632:Bob_Woodward:29> and you know *PRO*-1 not to ah spend a lot of time on the details /.
<214.581589958:223.317991632:Bob_Woodward:29> *PRO* Pull a camera back /.
<214.581589958:223.317991632:Bob_Woodward:29> what *T*-1 's going on here /.
<223.443514644:237.527196653:Bob_Woodward:30> But you know better than anyone 0 there is an informal network of reporters and government people on both sides democrats republicans ah liberals conservatives who *T*-1 talk to reporters /.
<223.443514644:237.527196653:Bob_Woodward:30> and <disfluency> i- y- </disfluency> <237.552301255:243.050209205:Bob_Woodward:31> I may talk to somebody /.
<237.552301255:243.050209205:Bob_Woodward:31> and we will talk about ninety or a hundred subjects /.
<243.112970711:248.987447699:Bob_Woodward:32> what 's *T*-1 going on /.
<243.112970711:248.987447699:Bob_Woodward:32> what do you hear *T*-1 /.
<243.112970711:248.987447699:Bob_Woodward:32> what does this look like *T*-1 /.
<243.112970711:248.987447699:Bob_Woodward:32> where is that going *T*-1 /.
<243.112970711:248.987447699:Bob_Woodward:32> what do n't we know *T*-1 /.  <247.317991632:252.60251046:speaker1:33> And then something *ICH*-1 comes up like this where suddenly you 're dealing with a covert operative *T*-2 /.
<252.615062762:257.887029289:speaker1:34> Maybe you did n't expect the person to say that /.
<252.615062762:257.887029289:speaker1:34> but you 've given your word *RNR*-1 , you 've given * your pledge *RNR*-1 , you 're going *-2 to protect this person /.
<257.548117155:271.983263598:Bob_Woodward:35> Yes <disfluency> but but </disfluency> but <disfluency> I do n't think peo- -- </disfluency> when we learn all about this *T*-1 um I think 0 very few people knew 0 she was a covert operative in the ~CIA , that she worked in the ~CIA as a <disfluency> ~W </disfluency> weapons of mass destruction analyst /.
<272.033472803:283.744769874:Bob_Woodward:36> so this is the kind of banter that *T*-2 goes on that *T*-3 helps the public and us figure out uh what the stories are *T*-4 , what *T*-5 's being hidden *-6 ah what games *T*-7 are being played *T*-8 and so forth /.
<283.757322176:287.79916318:speaker1:37> In other words *PRO* do n't underestimate the importance of these background or off the record conversations /.
<283.769874477:284.610878661:Bob_Woodward:38> <unintelligible> /.
<286.820083682:293.146443515:Bob_Woodward:39> <disfluency> E- </disfluency> exactly <disfluency> it </disfluency> it sounds kind of like <disfluency> a </disfluency> a ~BS session /.
<286.820083682:293.146443515:Bob_Woodward:39> <disfluency> a </disfluency> and some of it is *?* /.
<293.209205021:296.824267782:Bob_Woodward:40> but it 's a vital lifeline to the underbelly of government /.
<296.861924686:305.49790795:Bob_Woodward:41> For the special prosecutor to come *PRO*-1 roaring in here with a tank and say ah you know I 'm going *-2 to destroy that and ah <305.523012552:310.757322176:Bob_Woodward:42> here *PRO* look at Judy Miller , she never wrote a story about this this is totally ridiculous /.
<308.29707113:309.841004184:speaker1:43> Right <disfluency> you </disfluency> <disfluency> you mentioned -- </disfluency> <310.870292887:312.175732218:speaker1:44> you mentioned Karl Rove /.
<312.313807531:316.882845188:speaker1:45> Newsweek reports that he discussed Plame /.
<312.313807531:316.882845188:speaker1:45> and we have the email now ah with Matt Cooper /.
<316.907949791:321.087866109:speaker1:46> New York Times reports that Karl Rove discussed Plame with Carl Novak /.
<321.175732218:330.012552301:speaker1:47> Um does any of this reporting *ICH*-2 make you uncomfortable given all the books and articles written * about who Deep Throat was *T*-1 that reporters are now going up to other reporters ' sources on this story /?
<330.050209205:344.686192469:Bob_Woodward:48> Yeah sure and <disfluency> I </disfluency> <disfluency> I think 0 the -- </disfluency> I think 0 the prosecutor 's making a mistake /.
<330.050209205:344.686192469:Bob_Woodward:48> and I think 0 the judge in the case should 've been much more rigorous in *PRO* making the government really show 0 they have evidence of a crime and they need this testimony /.
<344.711297071:357.564853556:Bob_Woodward:49> <disfluency> All these discussions </disfluency> now it may turn out in the end *-1 to be very different /.
<344.711297071:357.564853556:Bob_Woodward:49> but all the discussions that Rove had *T*-2 with these two reporters Bob Novak and Matt Cooper that we know about *T*-3 and there may have been others <357.866108787:367.543933054:Bob_Woodward:50> were not about Valerie Plame as a covert undercover ~CIA operative whose identity *T*-4 had *-5 to be protected *-6 like the crown jewels /.
<367.556485356:367.845188285:speaker1:51> Right /.
<367.845188285:378.539748954:Bob_Woodward:52> it was about somebody in the ~CIA who *T*-7 was an analyst who *T*-8 got her husband this job *PRO* to go to Africa *PRO* to see if they could find evidence of wh- /-

<437.573221757:445.970711297:speaker1:65> Does McClellan 's role here remind you at all of the old Nixon spokesman Ron Zeigler calling Watergate *PRO*-1 a third - rate burglary and stonewalling *PRO* to use a Watergate term /?
<445.9958159:447.50209205:speaker1:66> Is the administration stonewalling here /?

<586.656903766:588.263598326:speaker4:87> I 'll never quote you /.
<590.661087866:593.234309623:speaker4:88> I would n't quote you even as an anonymous source /.
<593.384937238:596.008368201:speaker4:89> You 'd be on deep background /.
<596.133891213:601.154811715:speaker1:90> But of course in your book with Carl Bernstein and the movie you do describe a Deep Throat character /.
<601.230125523:604.581589958:speaker1:91> Did you have any reservations about that /.
<601.230125523:604.581589958:speaker1:91> were you betraying that agreement 0 we just saw *T*-1 /?
<604.543933054:614.271966527:Bob_Woodward:92> Ah no I really was n't because he also said that in the agreement was *T*-1 no disclosure but ah like all complicated relationships he said *PRO* push me /.
<614.359832636:620.723849372:Bob_Woodward:93> I 've been a street agent in the ~FBI /.
<614.359832636:620.723849372:Bob_Woodward:93> and you do n't get anywhere unless you push people like <uncertain> Hale </uncertain> /.
<614.359832636:620.723849372:Bob_Woodward:93> so *PRO* go ahead /.
<620.786610879:631.205020921:Bob_Woodward:94> So there are two tracks absolute confidentiality but *PRO* push <disfluency> as much <disfluency> *PRO* to get as much information , *PRO* confirm as much new information as possible /.
<631.355648536:638.510460251:Bob_Woodward:95> and ah when we wrote the book ah All the President 's Men *T*-1 Carl and I thought I mean how do you leave Deep Throat out *T*-2 /?
<638.661087866:649.606694561:Bob_Woodward:96> Ah *PRO* would 've been dishonest /.
<638.661087866:649.606694561:Bob_Woodward:96> Ah we concealed his identity in a way ah that it remained confidential for more than thirty years after that book came out <649.656903766:655.0041841:Bob_Woodward:97> and it only was disclosed *-1 because Mark Felt his lawyer and family decided *PRO*-2 to disclose it /.
<654.966527197:667.832635983:speaker1:98> How did you feel *T*-1 when more recently you saw that ~FBI memo that he had signed *T*-2 saying that Woodward and Berstein were reporting half - truths and fiction and we need *-3 to find the leakers *T*-4 this at the very time when he was meeting privately and secretly with you *T*-5 *PRO* kind of duplicitous /.
<666.677824268:676.117154812:Bob_Woodward:99> Yes <disfluency> o- i- </disfluency> it 's very <disfluency> d- </disfluency> duplicitous yes /.
<666.677824268:676.117154812:Bob_Woodward:99> but it 's also very careful because <disfluency> th- </disfluency> it was addressing a specific story that he was not a source of *T*-1 /.
<676.393305439:685.154811715:Bob_Woodward:100> And in the memo he says yes clearly ah they have access to ~FBI or justice department sources /.
<685.217573222:698.523012552:Bob_Woodward:101> And then in the process of this leak investigation which he is running *T*-1 he finds the leakers somebody in the White House and presumably one of the assistant prosecutors he alleges 0 *T*-2 /.
<685.217573222:698.523012552:Bob_Woodward:101> so it 's perfect /.
<698.661087866:712.807531381:Bob_Woodward:102> Ah and he sends this memo to the acting ~FBI director Al Patrick Grey /.
<698.661087866:712.807531381:Bob_Woodward:102> and then they send <disfluency> it </disfluency> a message *ICH*-1 to the Attorney General ah saying you know case closed *-2 we found out who *T*-3 did it /.
<698.661087866:712.807531381:Bob_Woodward:102> it 's perfect /.
<713.020920502:722.849372385:Bob_Woodward:103> Counter-intelligence <disfluency> i- </disfluency> it 's very sophisticated /.
<713.020920502:722.849372385:Bob_Woodward:103> it 's what somebody *ICH*-2 would do *T*-1 who *T*-3 was a Soviet spy or a spy in the Kremlin for us /.
<720.451882845:721.10460251:speaker1:104> Right /.
<722.836820084:730.230125523:speaker1:105> Now in nineteen seventy eight Felt was convicted *-1 *RNR*-2 later pardoned *-1 *RNR*-2 ah of *PRO* authorizing black - bag jobs against weathermen underground radicals /.
<730.242677824:731.761506276:speaker1:106> Um did that change your view of him /?
<731.761506276:737.861924686:speaker1:107> I mean here supposedly he 'd been outraged *-1 by Nixon White House corruption <disfluency> in </disfluency> in *PRO* dealing with you /.
<731.761506276:737.861924686:speaker1:107> and yet he engaged in some of it himself /.
<737.711297071:744.10041841:Bob_Woodward:108> Yes <disfluency> th- </disfluency> that 's right /.
<737.711297071:744.10041841:Bob_Woodward:108> and his justification was that there was a security threat /.
<737.711297071:744.10041841:Bob_Woodward:108> but there 's always a security threat /.
<744.138075314:752.861924686:Bob_Woodward:109> Um but <disfluency> it </disfluency> it is different because what Nixon was doing *T*-1 was for political purposes political intelligence um /.
<752.887029289:764.673640167:Bob_Woodward:110> The Weathermen were violent /.
<752.887029289:764.673640167:Bob_Woodward:110> there 's no question about it /.
<752.887029289:764.673640167:Bob_Woodward:110> I do n't think 0 they posed a threat to the republic that clearly at this moment Mark Felt and some other people in the ~FBI thought *T*-1 /.
<764.723849372:777.627615063:speaker1:111> You write ah here Bob Woodward that the portrait of me is not all that admirable /.
<764.723849372:777.627615063:speaker1:111> and you say that you lied to Richard Cohen the Washington Post columnist and your colleague ah who *T*-1 wanted *PRO*-2 to write a column this was twenty years ago <disfluency> about </disfluency> saying that he thought 0 Felt was Deep Throat /.
<777.765690377:781.255230126:speaker1:112> <disfluency> Why </disfluency> why did n't you just say I 'm not going *-1 to talk about it as you did when most journalists asked *T*-2 *T*-3 /?
<780.80334728:789.514644351:Bob_Woodward:113> <disfluency> Be- </disfluency> because he had the initials on the memo which *T*-1 were ~MF Mark Felt and he knew Carl Berstein 's wife <789.539748954:799.0041841:Bob_Woodward:114> and he was going *-2 to assert it with the kind of authority that *T*-3 is rare not rare for Richard as a columnist but uh that this was a fact /.
<799.205020921:808.769874477:Bob_Woodward:115> And this was a sensitive time /.
<799.205020921:808.769874477:Bob_Woodward:115> this was when Felt was on trial *T*-1 /.
<799.205020921:808.769874477:Bob_Woodward:115> this was ah either before *RNR*-3 or right after *RNR*-3 , he had been pardoned *-2 by Ronald Reagan /.
<808.769874477:815.974895397:Bob_Woodward:116> I had *-1 to protect the source /.
<808.769874477:815.974895397:Bob_Woodward:116> and Cohen was persistant /.
<808.769874477:815.974895397:Bob_Woodward:116> I could n't stop him without <uncertain> *PRO*-2 lying </uncertain> /.
<808.769874477:815.974895397:Bob_Woodward:116> I lied /.
<816.037656904:823.117154812:Bob_Woodward:117> <disfluency> I </disfluency> I regret *PRO*-1 doing that /.
<816.037656904:823.117154812:Bob_Woodward:117> and I 've apologized to him since /.
<816.037656904:823.117154812:Bob_Woodward:117> and he said well of course you lied /.
<816.037656904:823.117154812:Bob_Woodward:117> you have *-2 to protect the source /.
<823.192468619:825.025104603:Bob_Woodward:118> Ah it was just one column /.
<825.338912134:826.694560669:speaker1:119> All right we need *-1 to take a break /.
<826.694560669:831.627615063:speaker1:120> When we come back *T*-1 , was Mark Felt capable of informed consent in *PRO*-2 releasing his long held secret to the world /?
<831.627615063:834.414225941:speaker1:121> We 'll ask Bob Woodward that question next /.
<961.656903766:963.728033473:speaker6:122> ~CNN tonight at seven /.
<963.928870293:968.510460251:speaker6:123> After terrorist target London how 's the rest of the world winning the war on terror *T*-1 /?

<1002.84100418:1008.9916318:speaker1:127> For years you were tempted *-1 *PRO*-2 to call Mark Felt and to renew *RNR*-3 and perhaps repair *RNR*-3 your relationship with him /.
<1009.09205021:1011.25104603:speaker1:128> You say 0 you were gutless and you did n't do it /.
<1009.09205021:1011.25104603:speaker1:128> why /?
<1010.79916318:1022.08368201:Bob_Woodward:129> Yeah <disfluency> I I </disfluency> I was gutless um because <disfluency> h- </disfluency> you know he had gone through this trial , it looked like ten years in jail ah he was devastated *-1 and ah /-
<1021.36820084:1024.45606695:speaker1:130> And he 'd been cold toward you <unintelligible> /.
<1022.91213389:1026.81589958:Bob_Woodward:131> Yeah yeah he was not happy with the book and the movie ah /.
<1026.86610879:1036.85774059:Bob_Woodward:132> <disfluency> but </disfluency> but the main thing is this was a guy ah whose liberty *T*-1 was in jeopardy for about three or four years /.
<1026.86610879:1036.85774059:Bob_Woodward:132> he was pardoned *-2 by Reagan /.
<1026.86610879:1036.85774059:Bob_Woodward:132> and I felt 0 he dodged a bullet /.

<1056.57740586:1063.36820084:Bob_Woodward:135> and then ah very belatedly five years ago I went *PRO*-1 to see him /.
<1056.57740586:1063.36820084:Bob_Woodward:135> and his memory is gone /.

<1124.29707113:1134.08786611:Bob_Woodward:150> I think 0 in a sense <1134.26359833:1141.9707113:Bob_Woodward:151> ah he did n't look at himself as the Deep Throat who *T*-1 was kind of <disfluency> this </disfluency> this person who *T*-2 came forward <unintelligible> /.
<1140.94142259:1142.9623431:speaker1:152> The swashbuckling source /.

<1143.16317992:1146.33891213:speaker1:153> but he <disfluency> was also -- </disfluency> would n't volunteer information /.
<1143.21338912:1147.24267782:Bob_Woodward:154> Yeah <disfluency> h- </disfluency> he was careful /.

<1147.25523013:1161.30125523:Bob_Woodward:155> and <disfluency> that </disfluency> <disfluency> this was -- </disfluency> you know <disfluency> he </disfluency> this was a ~J Edgar Hoover man /.
<1147.25523013:1161.30125523:Bob_Woodward:155> and I think 0 we may find out someday ah <disfluency> I </disfluency> I hope 0 we do *?* that he studied at the feet of the master Hoover <disfluency> who </disfluency> who *T*-1 did things like this a lot /.

<1161.32635983:1171.44351464:speaker1:157> But was he capable *ICH*-1 now at the age of ninety one of *PRO*-2 giving informed consent *PRO* to go public /.
<1161.32635983:1171.44351464:speaker1:157> <disfluency> a- </disfluency> or did you decide 0 you were just not going *-3 to push him even if it meant that Vanity Fair or somebody else got that story first /?
<1171.23012552:1177.80753138:Bob_Woodward:158> Well I ah consulted Ben Bradley the former editor of the Post /.
<1171.23012552:1177.80753138:Bob_Woodward:158> and he said you really ca n't get informed consent /.
<1177.82008368:1197.72803347:Bob_Woodward:159> I <disfluency> c- </disfluency> ah consulted the best lawyer in town Bob Barnett /.
<1177.82008368:1197.72803347:Bob_Woodward:159> ah and he went through it and said you need voluntary absolute and ah competent ah declaration *ICH*-1 on his part that you were ah released *-2 from this agreement /.
<1177.82008368:1197.72803347:Bob_Woodward:159> and there was no way 0 *PRO* to get it ah given Mark Felt 's state of mind *T*-3 /.
<1197.74058577:1198.82008368:Bob_Woodward:160> so I backed off /.
<1199.0334728:1201.06694561:speaker1:161> All right Bob Woodward /.

<1383.32635983:1388.44769874:speaker1:165> Speculation about the cheif justice of the United States got out of control this past week /.
<1388.63598326:1392.9665272:speaker7:166> Many believe 0 it 's just a matter of time before Chief Justice William Rehnquist steps down /.
<1393.46861925:1402.16736402:speaker8:167> My source tells me that he is going *-1 to retire and the time of retiring is going *-2 to be as soon as the President is back in the country <1402.17991632:1404.77824268:speaker8:168> as soon as Air Force One lands in the country /.
<1405.06694561:1411.80753138:speaker9:169> What everyone believes *T*-1 and I guess 0 I do agree with this is that the Cheif Justice will now step down this week , that there will be two vacancies /.
<1412.39748954:1417.19246862:speaker1:170> Rehnquist of course now saying 0 he has no plans *PRO* to ah step down /.
<1412.39748954:1417.19246862:speaker1:170> was n't this the press that *T*-1 had speculated worse /?
<1417.30543933:1421.63598326:Bob_Woodward:171> Yeah it was *?* /.
<1417.30543933:1421.63598326:Bob_Woodward:171> and ah kind of stupidly so /.
<1421.66108787:1437.46443515:Bob_Woodward:172> Ah I mean <disfluency> th- </disfluency> there is a way 0 *PRO* to say look he 's ill *T*-1 /.
<1421.66108787:1437.46443515:Bob_Woodward:172> ah people are claiming 0 they have inside information /.
<1421.66108787:1437.46443515:Bob_Woodward:172> but I thought 0 ah Rehnquist said it best when somebody asked him recently *T*-2 and said 0 it 's 0 for me to know *T*-3 and you to find out *T*-3 /.
<1437.57740586:1440.86610879:Bob_Woodward:173> I remember *PRO*-1 hearing that phrase first in third grade /.
<1440.92887029:1442.10878661:speaker1:174> <unintelligible> /.
<1442.29707113:1444.28033473:speaker1:175> Now you wrote a book about the Supreme Court the Brethren /.
<1444.31799163:1450.51882845:speaker1:176> At the time Rehnquist was on the Supreme Court /.
<1444.31799163:1450.51882845:speaker1:176> five justices cooperated with you you 've said 0 *T*-1 /.
<1444.31799163:1450.51882845:speaker1:176> Rehnquist was one of them /?
<1450.59414226:1453.82008368:Bob_Woodward:177> I 'm not saying /.
<1450.59414226:1453.82008368:Bob_Woodward:177> we do n't disclose our sources /.
<1453.24267782:1454.9874477:speaker1:178> So there 's still Deep Throats on the court /?
<1455.0125523:1463.37238494:Bob_Woodward:179> That 's right /.
<1455.0125523:1463.37238494:Bob_Woodward:179> and you know we still protect sources who *T*-1 ah were justices or are justices perhaps /.
<1463.0460251:1466.33472803:speaker1:180> But you have <unintelligible> 0 Lewis Powell was one of your sources because he 's passed away /.
<1464.62761506:1473.0376569:Bob_Woodward:181> Yes yes <disfluency> he he </disfluency> he 's deceased /.
<1464.62761506:1473.0376569:Bob_Woodward:181> and it *EXP*-1 's very interesting *PRO* having a Supreme Court justice who *T*-2 's a confidential source /.
<1473.18828452:1481.58577406:Bob_Woodward:182> Ah someday when my notes on this are released *-1 *T*-2 you will see Supreme Court justices saying *PRO* come in the back door /.
<1481.61087866:1488.27615063:Bob_Woodward:183> ah ah *PRO* do n't quote a Justice because somebody will say which son of a bitch *T*-3 talked /.
<1488.35146444:1489.0041841:speaker1:184> <laugh> /.
<1489.25523013:1491.30125523:speaker1:185> Why do n't justices talk on the record *T*-1 /?
<1491.30125523:1494.36401674:speaker1:186> I mean <disfluency> there is -- </disfluency> it 's this kind of secretive shadowy institution /.
<1494.45188285:1497.30125523:speaker1:187> Um should they give more interviews to people like you /?
<1496.43514644:1505.07112971:Bob_Woodward:188> Oh of course <disfluency> ye- </disfluency> oh yes /.
<1496.43514644:1505.07112971:Bob_Woodward:188> I think 0 we need more sunlight on all institutions /.
<1496.43514644:1505.07112971:Bob_Woodward:188> and that 's why Scott Armstrong and I did the book ah on the Supreme Court *T*-1 /.
<1505.09623431:1513.79497908:Bob_Woodward:189> Ah people now realize that lots of the justices ' papers are avaliable how incredibly accurate and carefully that book was done *-1 *T*-2 /.
<1513.88284519:1519.33054393:speaker1:190> All right well I love the idea of justices spinning you on background at least trying *PRO*-1 to get their version of the truth out /.
<1519.35564854:1523.9623431:speaker1:191> Ah just breifly ah Mark Felt ah we were talking about 0 he 's made his own book and movie deal /.
<1524.0125523:1527.15062762:speaker1:192> Ah can you see Tom Hanks playing Deep Throat in the next movie /?
<1527.22594142:1533.67782427:Bob_Woodward:193> Um anything 's possible /.
<1527.22594142:1533.67782427:Bob_Woodward:193> maybe he 'll be playing Karl Rove in the next movie /.
<1527.22594142:1533.67782427:Bob_Woodward:193> who *T*-1 knows ah /.
<1533.69037657:1542.9916318:Bob_Woodward:194> Funny things happen /.  <1533.69037657:1542.9916318:Bob_Woodward:194> but I think 0 ah Felt 's lawyer and family can do ah something that *T*-1 's going *-2 to add to the record on all of this /.
<1542.9539749:1545.57740586:speaker1:195> All right we 'll wait and see /.
<1542.9539749:1545.57740586:speaker1:195> Bob Woodward thanks for *PRO* joining us /.
<1545.61506276:1546.0292887:Bob_Woodward:196> *PRO* Thank you /.
<1546.05439331:1547.29707113:speaker1:197> We 'll be right back /.
<124.448188711:129.856781803:speaker1:0> From ~NBC news in Washington this is Meet the Press with Jim Russert /.
<131.373209773:140.107972199:Tim_Russert:1> Our issues this Sunday the war in Iraq tensions with Iran and the future of this woman <140.107972199:144.964972199:Tim_Russert:2> our guest the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice /.
<145.672638585:149.22594861:Tim_Russert:3> Then will there be a White House staff shake - up /?
<149.680877001:154.08294861:Tim_Russert:4> And what is *T*-1 at stake in the two thousand six midterm elections /?
<154.08294861:170.57194861:Tim_Russert:5> Insight and analysis from David Broder of the Washington Post Elisabeth Bumiller White House correspondent for the New York Times Charlie Cook of the National Journal and John Harwood of the Wall Street Journal and ~CNBC /.
<173.95694861:177.03204465:Tim_Russert:6> But first as we begin the fourth year of the war in Iraq <177.03204465:178.796616681:Tim_Russert:7> we are joined *-1 by the Secretary of State /.
<178.796616681:180.189616681:Tim_Russert:8> *PRO* Welcome back Madame Secretary /.
<179.907354676:181.471259478:Condoleezza_Rice:9> Good morning /.
<179.907354676:181.471259478:Condoleezza_Rice:9> nice *PRO* to be with you Tim /.
<181.471259478:188.713165122:Tim_Russert:10> Very disturbing headlines in the papers yesterday the Russians helping Iraq /.  <181.471259478:188.713165122:Tim_Russert:10> and this is how it was captured *-1 in the paper *T*-2 /.
<188.713165122:202.506737995:Tim_Russert:11> Russian officials collected intelligence on ~US troop movements and attack plans from inside the American military command leading the two thousand and three invasion of Iraq and passed that information on to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein according to a ~US military study /.
<202.506737995:214.372762426:Tim_Russert:12> The intelligence report which the study said 0 *T*-1 were provided *-2 to Hussein through the Russian ambassador in Baghdad during the height of the ~US assault warned accurately that American formations intended *PRO*-3 to bypass Iraqi cities on their thrust towards Baghdad /.
<214.372762426:224.593738837:Tim_Russert:13> The reports provided some specific numbers on ~US troop units ' locations according to Iraqi documents dated * March and April oh three and later captured * by the United States /.
<224.593738837:227.14816765:Tim_Russert:14> Have you told the Russians what *T*-1 is going on /?
<227.14816765:231.209501264:Condoleezza_Rice:15> Well we 're trying first *PRO*-1 to <disfluency> m- </disfluency> make *PRO* *EXP*-2 sure 0 we understand fully what the documents say *T*-3 /.
<231.209501264:243.124287279:Condoleezza_Rice:16> Uh these are documents that *T*-1 were found *-2 uh in Iraqi stores /.
<231.209501264:243.124287279:Condoleezza_Rice:16> and obviously Tim we would take very seriously uh any suggestion that uh this may have been done *-1 uh maybe to the detriment of American forces /.
<243.124287279:246.076525695:Condoleezza_Rice:17> And so uh we will certainly raise it with the Russian government /.
<246.076525695:249.764049705:Condoleezza_Rice:18> We want *PRO*-1 to uh take a real hard look at the documents and then raise it with the Russian government /.
<249.764049705:252.442812131:Tim_Russert:19> But these are ~US documents a ~US report /.
<251.01937658:252.333614153:Condoleezza_Rice:20> <disfluency> Y- </disfluency> yes /.
<252.442812131:253.459812131:Tim_Russert:21> You believe the report /.
<252.889637742:259.410278012:Condoleezza_Rice:22> Oh <disfluency> I </disfluency> I certainly think 0 there is uh a lot to this report /.
<252.889637742:259.410278012:Condoleezza_Rice:22> but we really have n't <disfluency> a cha- </disfluency> had a chance *PRO*-1 to look at the documents in uh detail /.
<259.410278012:261.801518955:Condoleezza_Rice:23> *PRO* Intend *PRO*-1 to do that and then to raise it with the Russian government /.
<261.801518955:264.506518955:Condoleezza_Rice:24> I would hope 0 the Russian government will take it seriously /.
<263.757371525:267.030371525:Tim_Russert:25> Will there be an investigation as to who *T*-1 leaked the information to the Russians /?
<267.030371525:268.811705139:Condoleezza_Rice:26> Well <disfluency> I </disfluency> we 'll just have *-1 to see /.

<268.811705139:276.549062342:Condoleezza_Rice:27> <disfluency> I d- </disfluency> I do n't want *PRO*-1 to get ahead of us /.  <268.811705139:276.549062342:Condoleezza_Rice:27> but obviously we take very seriously uh any suggestion that uh this may have been done *-1 at the beginning of the war /.
<276.549062342:278.035871946:Condoleezza_Rice:28> That would be a quite serious charge /.
<276.549062342:279.414062342:Tim_Russert:29> <disfluency> Was it -- </disfluency> could it have been deliberate misinformation /?
<279.414062342:280.56920556:Condoleezza_Rice:30> I do n't know /.
<280.56920556:282.516348778:Condoleezza_Rice:31> I think 0 we really have *-1 to take a look at the documents /.
<282.516348778:285.821348778:Condoleezza_Rice:32> We 're finding thousands and thousands and thousands of documents /.
<285.821348778:291.950348778:Condoleezza_Rice:33> And uh we 're going *-1 to find <disfluency> some uh i- i- -- </disfluency> some important and uh surprising things in these documents /.
<291.950348778:297.327348778:Condoleezza_Rice:34> I think 0 we have *-1 to step back take a hard look at the documents /.
<291.950348778:297.327348778:Condoleezza_Rice:34> but <disfluency> I definitely -- </disfluency> we will raise it with the Russian government /.
<297.01769166:306.406310868:Tim_Russert:35> When we first went into Iraq *T*-1 we had some unexpected encounters with Fedayeen /.
<297.01769166:306.406310868:Tim_Russert:35> and we lost uh dozens of American men that Russians may have been responsible for American deaths /.
<306.406310868:311.649454086:Condoleezza_Rice:36> Well I do n't want *PRO*-1 to try hypothetically *PRO*-2 <disfluency> to </disfluency> to know what impact this might have had *T*-3 /.
<311.649454086:317.312978096:Condoleezza_Rice:37> I think 0 the first thing 0 we need *-1 to do *T*-2 is *PRO* take a good hard look at the documents /.
<311.649454086:317.312978096:Condoleezza_Rice:37> and then we definitely want *PRO*-3 to raise it with the Russian government /.
<317.312978096:323.3437877:Condoleezza_Rice:38> And again I would hope that the Russian government <disfluency> would </disfluency> uh would take it seriously <disfluency> and </disfluency> and give us a serious answer on what they find *T*-1 /.
<323.3437877:327.909074136:Tim_Russert:39> Back in June of two thousand one the president said 0 he looked Vladimir Putin in the eye /.
<327.909074136:332.798074136:Tim_Russert:40> He got a sense of his soul found him to be very straightforward and very trustworthy /.
<332.798074136:337.711074136:Tim_Russert:41> Does the president still believe that President Putin is straightforward and trustworthy /?
<337.711074136:341.956407751:Condoleezza_Rice:42> I really do think that the Russians have generally done what they said 0 they would do *T*-1 /.
<341.956407751:346.485407751:Condoleezza_Rice:43> They said 0 they were going *-1 to oppose the Iraq War and they did *?* /.
<341.956407751:346.485407751:Condoleezza_Rice:43> and they told us that from the very beginning /.
<346.485407751:352.930741365:Condoleezza_Rice:44> Uh so I do n't have an argument there /.
<346.485407751:352.930741365:Condoleezza_Rice:44> and I do n't want *PRO*-1 to jump to the conclusion that this was something that *T*-2 was ordered *-3 out of the Kremlin /.
<352.930741365:354.237573715:Condoleezza_Rice:45> We have *-1 to look at the documents /.
<354.237573715:363.227741365:Condoleezza_Rice:46> We have *-1 to go to the Russian government /.
<354.237573715:363.227741365:Condoleezza_Rice:46> but I would hope that the Russian government would take seriously uh any suggestion uh that they may have passed uh data to the Iraqis uh at the advent of the war /.
<363.227741365:365.672313395:Tim_Russert:47> But the Russian ambassador is the source /.
<365.672313395:371.649313395:Tim_Russert:48> How could Putin not have known *T*-1 /.
<365.672313395:371.649313395:Tim_Russert:48> and how could it *EXP*-1 be straightforward and honest for the Russians to help Saddam Hussein *T*-2 /?
<371.649313395:374.936075821:Condoleezza_Rice:49> Tim we have *-1 to get to the bottom of the facts of this /.
<374.936075821:377.232314238:Condoleezza_Rice:50> We will most certainly raise it with the Russian government /.
<377.232314238:380.29221904:Condoleezza_Rice:51> <disfluency> I </disfluency> I 've said several times 0 it 's a serious matter /.
<380.29221904:386.68521904:Condoleezza_Rice:52> but uh I do n't want *PRO*-1 to jump out ahead and start *-2 making accusations about what uh the Russians may *RNR*-3 or may not *RNR*-3 have known *T*-4 /.
<386.68521904:397.03821904:Condoleezza_Rice:53> This is something in a relationship that we have *T*-1 with the Russians that *T*-2 really is candid and where we do talk about difficult things all the time *T*-3 , where I think 0 we 'll be able *PRO*-4 to talk about this and talk about it uh honestly *T*-5 /.
<397.03821904:403.701028644:Tim_Russert:54> Why wo n't the Russians help us get sanctions in the United Nations against Iran and try *PRO*-1 to stop them from *PRO*-2 developing nuclear weapons *T*-3 /?
<403.369839933:406.466792755:Condoleezza_Rice:55> Well we 're not yet at the stage where we 're seeking sanctions *T*-1 /.
<406.466792755:418.654697557:Condoleezza_Rice:56> Uh what we 're doing *T*-1 now is uh we 're seeking a presidential statement that *T*-2 would make clear to Iran the international community 's determination that it live up to the obligations that everyone thinks 0 Iran has *T*-3 /.
<418.654697557:419.863697557:Condoleezza_Rice:57> We 're working through it /.
<419.863697557:422.470459983:Condoleezza_Rice:58> Uh we have <disfluency> a s- -- </disfluency> the same strategy here /.
<422.470459983:425.239459983:Condoleezza_Rice:59> We have the same uh view of the problem /.
<425.239459983:428.861508003:Condoleezza_Rice:60> The Russians do not want a nuclear <disfluency> rec- </disfluency> weapon in Iran either /.
<428.861508003:444.21374642:Condoleezza_Rice:61> It *EXP*-5 's been very clear in everything that they have tried *PRO*-1 to do *T*-2 in the way that they set up the civil nuclear cooporation with Bushehr *T*-3 in what they offered the Iranians *T*-4 that the Russians also do not believe that there should be enrichment and reprocessing capability on Iranian soil /.
<444.21374642:448.135460826:Condoleezza_Rice:62> And uh enrichment and reprocessing capability is the core here /.
<448.135460826:453.394604044:Condoleezza_Rice:63> If you 're able *PRO*-1 to enrich and reprocess then the ability *PRO* to build a bomb is is there /.
<453.394604044:460.779604044:Condoleezza_Rice:64> And so we and the Russians uh the Chinese and certainly the Europeans have the same view of <disfluency> what *T*-1 is -- </disfluency> what *T*-2 is to be prevented *-3 /.
<460.779604044:468.348556866:Condoleezza_Rice:65> Uh yes we 've had some tactical differences on how *PRO* to get there *T*-1 /.
<460.779604044:468.348556866:Condoleezza_Rice:65> but uh I talked with my Russian counterpart uh on Friday /.
<468.348556866:474.084795282:Condoleezza_Rice:66> We agreed that our people would go back and work very hard this weekend and we 'll see where we are *T*-1 on Monday /.
<474.084795282:488.816985678:Condoleezza_Rice:67> Um we 're considering whether it *EXP*-1 might be a good idea *PRO* to <disfluency> get </disfluency> um after we have a presidential statement uh get ministers together again uh with the the ~P five the permanent five of the Security Council plus Germany uh *PRO* to talk about *PRO* charting a course forward <488.816985678:498.120509688:Condoleezza_Rice:68> because everybody takes very seriously Iran 's intransigence and Iran 's unwillingness uh *PRO* to do what the international community <disfluency> is <uncertain> bid- </uncertain> -- </disfluency> is uh determined that it will do *T*-2 /.
<498.120509688:502.753509688:Tim_Russert:69> It *EXP*-1 is the policy of our government that Iran will not be allowed *-2 to develop a nuclear weapon /.
<502.753509688:505.9159385:Condoleezza_Rice:70> <disfluency> I- i- </disfluency> Tim Iran can not be allowed *-1 to develop a nuclear weapon /.
<505.9159385:509.103843302:Condoleezza_Rice:71> That is the view of the international community not just the United States /.
<509.103843302:511.162224937:Tim_Russert:72> This article is in the New York Times /.
<511.162224937:530.583749789:Tim_Russert:73> The reality is that most of us think 0 the Iranians are probably going *-1 to get a weapon or the technology 0 *PRO* to make one *T*-2 sooner or later an administration official acknowledged 0 *T*-3 a few weeks ago *PRO*-4 refusing *PRO*-5 to talk on the record because such an admission amounts to a concession that *PRO* dragging Iran in front of the United Nations Security Council may prove an exercise in futility /.
<530.583749789:540.888749789:Tim_Russert:74> The optomists around here about the White House just hope 0 we can delay the day by ten or twenty years and that by that time we 'll have a different relationship with a different Iranian government /.
<540.888749789:542.545749789:Tim_Russert:75> That seems like a much different policy /.
<542.545749789:549.13579781:Condoleezza_Rice:76> Well <disfluency> I </disfluency> since I do n't know who this anonymous person is *T*-1 I ca n't tell you <disfluency> what uh w- </disfluency> what relationship *ICH*-3 they may have *T*-2 to the policy /.
<549.13579781:550.377465038:Condoleezza_Rice:77> I 'll tell you who *T*-1 does n't think that /.
<550.377465038:552.118037068:Condoleezza_Rice:78> I do n't believe uh that /.
<552.118037068:560.64846588:Condoleezza_Rice:79> I do n't believe that the President believes that because we 're doing everything that we can *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to uh send a strong signal *ICH*-3 to the Iranians that they have no choice /.
<560.64846588:569.97746588:Condoleezza_Rice:80> If they wish *PRO*-1 to be a part of the international community they have no choice but *PRO*-2 to give up ambitions that *T*-3 could lead to the technologies that *T*-4 would lead to a nuclear weapon /.
<569.97746588:582.20246588:Condoleezza_Rice:81> Uh if the international community stays really solid here Iran can not stand the kind of isolation from the international community that for instance North Korea endures *T*-1 almost by choice /.
<582.20246588:588.24346588:Condoleezza_Rice:82> We really do have a chance *PRO* to solve this diplomatically /.
<582.20246588:588.24346588:Condoleezza_Rice:82> but Tim I would be the first 0 *T*-1 to say 0 we ca n't afford *PRO*-2 to waste time /.
<588.24346588:594.821133109:Condoleezza_Rice:83> That 's why we need <disfluency> our </disfluency> our people <disfluency> in </disfluency> in New York to really work toward this first phase *T*-1 /.
<594.821133109:601.318133109:Condoleezza_Rice:84> We need *-1 to see if that has <disfluency> a </disfluency> an effect on the Iranians /.
<594.821133109:601.318133109:Condoleezza_Rice:84> and if it does not have an effect on the Iranians we need *-1 to move to the next phase /.
<601.318133109:602.013657119:Tim_Russert:85> Which *T*-1 is /?
<602.013657119:607.683657961:Condoleezza_Rice:86> The next phase is uh *PRO* to look to uh further uh options in the Security Council /.
<607.683657961:609.740657961:Condoleezza_Rice:87> For instance perhaps the chapter seven resolution /.
<609.740657961:610.809277169:Tim_Russert:88> Which *T*-1 is /?
<610.809277169:618.426229992:Condoleezza_Rice:89> Chapter seven resolution essentially gives uh the ~UN or the Security Council the ability *PRO* to compel a state *PRO*-1 to act /.
<618.426229992:623.5988492:Condoleezza_Rice:90> Uh it <disfluency> i- </disfluency> can um say that there would be consequences if actions are not taken *-1 /.
<623.5988492:624.5598492:Tim_Russert:91> Including military /?
<624.5598492:629.690992418:Condoleezza_Rice:92> Well uh no one ever takes anything off the table /.
<624.5598492:629.690992418:Condoleezza_Rice:92> but I believe 0 we 're a long way <disfluency> from </disfluency> uh from that /.
<629.690992418:634.923992418:Condoleezza_Rice:93> We have the possibilities of financial measures that *T*-1 could be taken *-2 uh bans against travel /.
<634.923992418:638.57442123:Condoleezza_Rice:94> <disfluency> There are -- </disfluency> there are a lot of uh options once you 're in the Security Council /.
<638.57442123:655.93542123:Condoleezza_Rice:95> That 's why it *EXP*-1 was very important *PRO* to get this uh <disfluency> dossier </disfluency> Iranian dossier to the Security Council *T*-2 and why the diplomacy that we 've been working *T*-3 over the last uh couple of years *PRO* to get the Europeans and the United States on the same page and to now bring the Russians and the Chinese along uh has been so important *T*-4 /.
<655.93542123:663.24842123:Tim_Russert:96> <disfluency> D- </disfluency> do you believe 0 if the President chose *PRO*-1 to embark on military action with Iran he would go to Congress for authorization first /?
<663.24842123:664.952659646:Condoleezza_Rice:97> I 'm not going *-1 to speculate on that /.
<664.952659646:669.775422072:Condoleezza_Rice:98> The president uh <disfluency> v- </disfluency> is uh <disfluency> v- </disfluency> clear that he keeps all of his options on the table /.
<669.775422072:677.633136479:Condoleezza_Rice:99> But Tim I think 0 *PRO* speculating about how we might uh set up military action *T*-1 is n't helpful at a time when we really are concentrating on the diplomacy *T*-2 /.
<677.633136479:678.792660489:Condoleezza_Rice:100> But I want *PRO*-1 to be very clear /.
<678.247683235:679.832683235:Tim_Russert:101> But you would n't go to Congress /?
<679.157540017:684.750540017:Condoleezza_Rice:102> Well eh Tim of course the uh administration went to Congress uh the last time /.
<684.750540017:690.001683235:Condoleezza_Rice:103> And I would just uh ask people *PRO*-1 to look at the history of how this president <disfluency> has </disfluency> uh has acted *T*-2 /.
<690.001683235:698.584492839:Condoleezza_Rice:104> He has uh taken Congress as a full partner in these matters /.
<690.001683235:698.584492839:Condoleezza_Rice:104> but I 'm not going *-1 to get into a discussion of what the President may *RNR*-2 or may not *RNR*-2 do *T*-3 uh constitutionally /.
<698.163437237:700.302580455:Tim_Russert:105> *PRO* Let me turn back to Iraq /.
<700.879580455:704.702342881:Tim_Russert:106> The war now in its fourth year /.
<700.879580455:704.702342881:Tim_Russert:106> and these are the grim statistics /.
<704.702342881:707.262005055:Tim_Russert:107> ~US troops killed two thousand three hundred and sixteen . <707.262005055:709.9915754:Tim_Russert:108> Wounded injured seventeen thousand two hundred seventy - one /.
<709.9915754:713.327716933:Tim_Russert:109> Iraqis killed * an <disfluency> estimate num- </disfluency> estimated number is thirty thousand /.

<715.767295703:725.360295703:Tim_Russert:111> When you were planning the war some three and a half years ago *T*-1 did you have any idea that three years into the war those are the numbers that you would be confronting *T*-2 /?
<725.360295703:727.563796124:Condoleezza_Rice:112> Well I certainly thought that it would be difficult /.
<727.563796124:732.788542544:Condoleezza_Rice:113> Um I do n't think 0 anyone um knew precisely what we would be facing *T*-1 in terms of numbers /.
<732.788542544:738.685867733:Condoleezza_Rice:114> And * look /.
<732.788542544:738.685867733:Condoleezza_Rice:114> every one of those deaths is uh mourned *-1 by people in the administration <738.685867733:744.313395114:Condoleezza_Rice:115> uh because these are families that *T*-2 have lost um husbands and wives and daughters and sons /.
<744.313395114:748.638867733:Condoleezza_Rice:116> Um but we also know that nothing of value is ever won *-1 without sacrifice /.
<748.638867733:756.109272957:Condoleezza_Rice:117> We 're in Iraq because the um United States of America faces a different kind of enemy and a different kind of war /.
<756.109272957:769.038272957:Condoleezza_Rice:118> And we have *-1 to have a different kind of Middle East if we 're ever going *-2 to resolve <disfluency> the uh the </disfluency> the problems of an ideology of hatred that *T*-3 was so great that people flew airplanes into buildings /.
<769.038272957:772.761416175:Condoleezza_Rice:119> <disfluency> Iraq was a -- </disfluency> Saddam Hussein 's Iraq was a threat /.
<772.761416175:774.152893007:Condoleezza_Rice:120> Now that the /-
<772.761416175:776.490416175:Tim_Russert:121> <disfluency> B- but </disfluency> but Saddam was not related *-1 to *PRO* flying airplanes into buildings /.
<775.299073294:781.108073294:Condoleezza_Rice:122> No /.
<775.299073294:781.108073294:Condoleezza_Rice:122> and we have never said that Saddam /-
<775.299073294:781.108073294:Condoleezza_Rice:122> <disfluency> u- </disfluency> uh Saddam was not related *-1 to the events of September eleventh /.
<781.108073294:789.361406908:Condoleezza_Rice:123> But if you really believe that the only thing that *T*-1 happened on September eleventh was 0 people flew airplanes into buildings I think 0 you have a very narrow view of what we faced *T*-2 on September eleventh /.
<789.361406908:796.484192923:Condoleezza_Rice:124> We faced <disfluency> the </disfluency> um the outcome of an ideology of hatred throughout the Middle East that *T*-1 had *-2 to be dealt with *-3 /.
<796.484192923:799.585883741:Condoleezza_Rice:125> Saddam Hussein was a part of that old Middle East /.
<799.585883741:803.998502949:Condoleezza_Rice:126> The new Iraq will be a part of a new Middle East /.
<799.585883741:803.998502949:Condoleezza_Rice:126> and we will all be safer /.
<803.998502949:809.110647009:Tim_Russert:127> But Madame Secretary weapons of mass destruction was the primary rationale given * *PRO* to go into Iraq /.
<809.110647009:818.568314238:Tim_Russert:128> Lisa Myers of ~NBC news broke a story *ICH*-1 last week that the Iraqi foreign minister Mister Sabri <disfluency> w- </disfluency> became a spy for the French <disfluency> and </disfluency> and the ~CIA /.
<818.568314238:819.829243471:Tim_Russert:129> And this is how it was reported *-1 *T*-2 /.
<819.829243471:834.879506318:Tim_Russert:130> Saddam Hussein 's last foreign minister Naji Sabri paid spy for +French intelligence later turned him over to the ~CIA *PRO* to supply information about Iraq its chemical biological nuclear weapon program more than six months before the war began in March of oh three according {to} former intelligence officials /.
<834.879506318:841.133412805:Tim_Russert:131> The sources said 0 he provided information 0 {the?} Iraqi dictator had ambitions for a nuclear program but it was not active <841.133412805:846.149427491:Tim_Russert:132> and that no biological weapons were being produced or stockpiled *-1 although research was under way /.
<846.149427491:848.954501536:Tim_Russert:133> That 's a far cry from what the American people were told *-1 *T*-2 /.
<848.954501536:853.011501536:Condoleezza_Rice:134> Of course Tim this was a single source among multiple sources /.
<853.011501536:862.628501536:Condoleezza_Rice:135> And the problem was that Saddam Hussein was unwilling *ICH*-1 after multiple <disfluency> revel- </disfluency> resolutions in the Security Council *PRO*-2 to account for his uh weapons programs /.
<862.628501536:874.725501536:Condoleezza_Rice:136> Uh we all remember that the accounting of the ~UN <disfluency> mission that *T*-1 was suppo- </disfluency> uh weapons inspection mission that *T*-2 was supposed *-3 to uh look into its weapons program could not account for large stockpiles /.
<874.725501536:879.262501536:Condoleezza_Rice:137> We all thought that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction /.
<879.262501536:886.544501536:Condoleezza_Rice:138> He certainly had a a very healthy appetite for them /.
<879.262501536:886.544501536:Condoleezza_Rice:138> and he had used them before both against his own people and against his neighbors /.
<886.544501536:887.552276306:Condoleezza_Rice:139> He was a threat /.
<887.552276306:893.569276306:Condoleezza_Rice:140> This was someone <disfluency> flying uh against our aircraft or or i- </disfluency> shooting at our aircraft as they flew the no - fly zone /.
<893.569276306:895.250276306:Condoleezza_Rice:141> He 'd invaded his neighbors /.
<895.250276306:902.511723051:Condoleezza_Rice:142> But the point is that now that he 's gone Iraq has an opportunity *PRO* to be a different Iraq in a different kind of Middle East /.
<902.511723051:903.600723051:Condoleezza_Rice:143> I know 0 it 's hard /.
<903.600723051:906.952421302:Condoleezza_Rice:144> And I know that the numbers that you 've put *T*-1 up are difficult 0 *PRO* to see *T*-2 /.
<906.952421302:910.030659359:Condoleezza_Rice:145> And I know that the violence on ~TV is difficult /.
<910.030659359:916.231659359:Condoleezza_Rice:146> But I would ask people to uh *PRO*-1 to look at the perspective here of what *T*-2 is really going on in Iraq /.
<916.231659359:927.289659359:Condoleezza_Rice:147> <disfluency> Under this -- </disfluency> uh <disfluency> the violence </disfluency> under the specter of this violence you have Iraqis *ICH*-1 now Sunni Shia Kurds and others determined *PRO*-2 to form a government of national unity /.
<927.289659359:933.858659359:Condoleezza_Rice:148> That 's extraordinary in Iraq 's history where they 've always settled their differences by violence not by politics *T*-1 /.
<933.858659359:942.165986766:Condoleezza_Rice:149> And when they succeed in that *T*-1 <disfluency> you </disfluency> uh they are going *-2 to have the basis for a very uh different kind of Iraq /.
<933.858659359:942.165986766:Condoleezza_Rice:149> and I think 0 they 're going *-1 to succeed /.
<942.165986766:950.230986766:Tim_Russert:150> But people are being asked *-1 *PRO*-2 to take your judgement on this as we sit here this morning and refer to previous judgements 0 the administration made *T*-3 /.
<950.230986766:952.423986766:Tim_Russert:151> Weapons of mass destruction there were none /.
<952.423986766:955.472986766:Tim_Russert:152> We would be greeted *-1 as liberators /.
<952.423986766:955.472986766:Tim_Russert:152> this is three years later /.
<955.472986766:959.452462882:Tim_Russert:153> That <disfluency> th- </disfluency> it *EXP*-1 would not take hundreds of thousands of American troops *PRO* to occupy Iraq /.
<959.452462882:966.285462882:Tim_Russert:154> Tommy Franks according to the book Cobra Two said 0 we 'd be down to thirty thousand troops in November of oh three /.
<966.285462882:970.618894323:Tim_Russert:155> The cost of the war the budget director of the White House said 0 it 'd be fifty billion dollars /.
<970.618894323:972.987894323:Tim_Russert:156> It 's now over three hundred and fifty billion dollars /.
<972.987894323:975.411894323:Tim_Russert:157> Each judgement has proven *-1 to be wrong /.
<975.411894323:985.364894323:Condoleezza_Rice:158> The judgement that *T*-1 has not proven *-2 to be wrong uh Tim is that the region is changing in fundemental ways and the region is better without Saddam Hussein /.
<985.364894323:989.624773747:Condoleezza_Rice:159> Yes it *EXP*-1 is true that uh everyone thought 0 he had weapons of mass destruction /.
<989.624773747:990.321773747:Condoleezza_Rice:160> He did not *?* /.
<990.321773747:995.746773747:Condoleezza_Rice:161> It *EXP*-1 is by the way the case that the Iraqis are delighted *PRO*-2 to be rid *-3 of him /.
<995.746773747:1006.04377375:Condoleezza_Rice:162> And <disfluency> some Iraqis </disfluency> uh most Iraqis in fact uh are willing *RNR*-1 and uh want *RNR*-1 *PRO* to keep coalition forces there until they can uh take care of this themselves /.
<1006.04377375:1009.02077375:Condoleezza_Rice:163> But we do have *-1 to keep things in historical perspective /.
<1009.02077375:1015.22177375:Condoleezza_Rice:164> These people are doing something that *T*-1 is quite unknown in the Middle East /.  <1009.02077375:1015.22177375:Condoleezza_Rice:164> and one has *-1 to ask what was the alternative *T*-2 /?
<1015.22177375:1035.58866909:Condoleezza_Rice:165> Was the alternative *PRO* to leave Saddam Hussein in power uh *PRO*-1 continuing *-2 to threaten his neighbors *PRO*-1 continuing with his uh windfall profits from the oil for food scandal *PRO*-1 continuing *-3 to repress uh his people and build mass graves uh *PRO*-1 continuing *-4 to uh use those oil for food profits *PRO*-5 to again build the infrastructure for his weapons of mass destruction /?
<1034.21805203:1036.95757406:Tim_Russert:166> But many will say 0 he was contained *-1 by the no - fly zone /.
<1036.78916102:1040.83229504:Condoleezza_Rice:167> Ah <disfluency> I do n't think that there is anyone -- </disfluency> <disfluency> I </disfluency> I do not think that he was in a box /.
<1037.75859555:1038.71222409:Tim_Russert:168> He was in a box /.
<1040.83229504:1048.29191925:Condoleezza_Rice:169> <disfluency> It i- </disfluency> the oil for food program alone shows that the billions of dollars that he was collecting *T*-1 /-
<1040.83229504:1048.29191925:Condoleezza_Rice:169> He was not just going *-1 to build palaces /.
<1048.29191925:1053.36154531:Condoleezza_Rice:170> This was someone who *T*-1 had an insatiable appetite uh *PRO*-2 to dominate his region /.
<1053.36154531:1065.85208202:Condoleezza_Rice:171> Now without Saddam Hussein you can look across the region and see that uh a lot is changing thanks to the President 's democracy uh promotion and the hard work of people in those countries /.
<1065.85208202:1068.18108202:Condoleezza_Rice:172> You have Syrian forces out of Lebanon /.
<1068.18108202:1071.75008202:Condoleezza_Rice:173> You have uh Saddam Hussein out of uh Iraq /.
<1071.75008202:1077.29111015:Condoleezza_Rice:174> The people of the Middle East are taking on authoritarian governments across the Middle East /.
<1077.29111015:1079.55316951:Condoleezza_Rice:175> Kuwait has given women the right *PRO* to vote /.
<1079.55316951:1085.78616951:Condoleezza_Rice:176> I 'd be the first 0 *T*-1 to say that these big historical changes are turbulent and they 're difficult /.
<1085.78616951:1102.38834821:Condoleezza_Rice:177> But the notion that somehow there was a placid Middle East , that if we just left it alone , if we 'd just not invaded Iraq , if we had just not overthrown dictators , if we {had?} just not challenged Syrian power in Lebanon everything would be just fine uh is simply not true /.
<1102.38834821:1110.45334821:Condoleezza_Rice:178> It was that Middle East the malignancy of the Middle East that we quote unquote disturbed *T*-1 that *T*-2 led directly to the September eleventh event /.
<1110.26597641:1121.99497641:Tim_Russert:179> The President said this week that whether there 'll be troops in Iraq for the <disfluency> f- </disfluency> unforeseeable future will be determined *-1 by the next president *PRO* meaning 0 we 're going *-2 to have troops in Iraq at least through January of oh nine /.
<1121.99497641:1131.03597641:Condoleezza_Rice:180> Oh the President was asked *-1 this question in a particular way /.
<1121.99497641:1131.03597641:Condoleezza_Rice:180> and he <disfluency> e- </disfluency> answered that uh some American troops may well be there for the next president /.
<1131.03597641:1142.98155779:Condoleezza_Rice:181> But I would just point to what *ICH*-2 uh the President has said *T*-1 continually which *T*-3 is that American forces are going *-4 to come down uh *PRO* commensurate with the need as Iraqi forces stand up /.
<1131.03597641:1142.98155779:Condoleezza_Rice:181> and they are indeed standing up /.
<1142.98155779:1162.07736193:Condoleezza_Rice:182> General Casey has talked about a significant reduction of American forces over the next year /.
<1142.98155779:1162.07736193:Condoleezza_Rice:182> and that significant reduction is because Iraqi forces are taking and holding territory now because during this most recent uptick of sectarian violence the Iraqi army uh uh behaved very very well /.
<1162.07736193:1173.10992802:Condoleezza_Rice:183> So Iraqi forces are getting better /.
<1162.07736193:1173.10992802:Condoleezza_Rice:183> American forces are ceding territory /.
<1162.07736193:1173.10992802:Condoleezza_Rice:183> and I think 0 it *EXP*-1 's entirely uh probable that we will see a significant draw - down of American forces over the <disfluency> next </disfluency> uh next year /.
<1173.10992802:1174.47892802:Condoleezza_Rice:184> That 's what General Casey believes *T*-1 /.
<1173.26868388:1174.29607374:Tim_Russert:185> Was /-
<1173.26868388:1174.29607374:Tim_Russert:185> this year /.
<1175.04792802:1182.5210455:Condoleezza_Rice:186> It 's all dependent <disfluency> on the ground but this i- </disfluency> <disfluency> on </disfluency> on events on the ground /.
<1175.04792802:1182.5210455:Condoleezza_Rice:186> but as General Casey has said *?* we see the progress with Iraqi forces /.
<1182.5210455:1184.7860455:Condoleezza_Rice:187> We see the progress of the political process /.
<1184.7860455:1188.61471624:Condoleezza_Rice:188> And uh there 's every reason 0 *PRO* to believe that American forces can start *-1 to <uncertain> draw </uncertain> down *T*-2 /.
<1187.73117192:1189.79617192:Tim_Russert:189> Is the insurgency in its last throes /?
<1189.79617192:1197.916738:Condoleezza_Rice:190> Well the insurgency uh politicially is certainly <disfluency> in </disfluency> in danger because {of?} the Sunnis who *T*-1 stood outside of the political process /.
<1196.7405907:1198.97669474:Tim_Russert:191> But in terms of violence is it in its last throes /?
<1198.65311644:1205.57400629:Condoleezza_Rice:192> Well <disfluency> i- </disfluency> the insurgency is still able <disfluency> to </disfluency> uh *PRO*-1 to pull off violence and kill innocent children or kill an innocent school teacher /.
<1205.57400629:1209.08063785:Condoleezza_Rice:193> Yes they are able *PRO*-1 to do that /.
<1205.57400629:1209.08063785:Condoleezza_Rice:193> and they might be able *PRO*-1 to do that <disfluency> some ti- </disfluency> for some time /.
<1209.08063785:1213.06963662:Condoleezza_Rice:194> But what they 've not been able *PRO*-1 to do *T*-2 is *PRO* to disrupt the political process /.
<1213.06963662:1218.73463662:Condoleezza_Rice:195> What they 've not been able *PRO*-1 to do *T*-2 is *PRO* to set Iraqis uh one against another in the political process /.
<1218.73463662:1220.86363662:Condoleezza_Rice:196> They 've not been able *PRO*-1 to stop <uncertain> three </uncertain> elections /.
<1220.86363662:1224.31263662:Condoleezza_Rice:197> They 're not able *PRO*-1 to stop formation of uh the government /.
<1224.31263662:1231.02563662:Condoleezza_Rice:198> Uh a few violent people can always uh grab headlines and can always kill innocent people /.
<1229.94954639:1231.02254639:Tim_Russert:199> It 's more than a few /.
<1231.02254639:1234.95129639:Condoleezza_Rice:200> Well it 's a few in terms of the population of Iraqis /.
<1234.95129639:1237.58431992:Tim_Russert:201> But it could not exist without *PRO*-1 being enabled *-2 by the population /.
<1237.15729496:1240.67029496:Condoleezza_Rice:202> Well the population is less and less enabling every day /.
<1240.67029496:1247.80653026:Condoleezza_Rice:203> There are reports that Zarqawi and al - Qaeda meet stiff resistance indeed violent resistance from Iraqi tribes /.
<1247.80653026:1250.51953026:Condoleezza_Rice:204> Sunnis are now a part of the political process /.
<1250.51953026:1254.81816123:Condoleezza_Rice:205> And I know that people wonder when will the government formation finish *T*-1 /.
<1254.81816123:1258.14716123:Condoleezza_Rice:206> Uh <disfluency> it </disfluency> it seems *-1 to be dragging on after the election /.
<1258.14716123:1263.33216123:Condoleezza_Rice:207> But I would just note 0 I read the other day 0 someone said well they 're dividing up the spoils of the offices /.
<1263.33216123:1265.1985569:Condoleezza_Rice:208> That 's not what they 're doing *T*-1 in this process /.
<1265.1985569:1269.69374406:Condoleezza_Rice:209> They are writing a government program on which the national unity will govern *T*-1 /.
<1269.69374406:1271.93474406:Condoleezza_Rice:210> They are writing the rules by which they will govern *T*-1 /.
<1271.93474406:1276.49295025:Condoleezza_Rice:211> And <disfluency> they 're defi- -- </disfluency> <uncertain> they 're <disfluency> trying *PRO* to </disfluency> </uncertain> determining who *T*-1 will take key positions /.
<1276.49295025:1287.22995025:Condoleezza_Rice:212> So this is uh an extraordinary matter an extraordinary scene with Iraqis Sunni and Shia and Kurds all working together toward a unity government /.
<1287.24765817:1288.76962783:Tim_Russert:213> *PRO* Let me turn to Afghanistan /.
<1288.76962783:1295.01581049:Tim_Russert:214> There 's a story *ICH*-1 moving on the wires that the Afghan court has just dismissed the charges against this gentleman who *T*-2 had converted to Christianity /.
<1295.01581049:1296.30526003:Tim_Russert:215> Are you aware 0 that was going *-1 to happen /?
<1296.06281168:1299.59867484:Condoleezza_Rice:216> <disfluency> I </disfluency> I ca n't confirm uh that particular report uh Tim /.
<1299.59867484:1301.48866803:Condoleezza_Rice:217> I know that the Afghans are working on it /.
<1301.48866803:1307.12966803:Condoleezza_Rice:218> They 've been very aware um of the issue and of the concerns about the issue /.
<1307.12966803:1317.73002779:Condoleezza_Rice:219> This is a young democracy that *T*-1 is uh working with a constitution that uh like many constitutions when they 're first born *-2 *T*-3 uh <disfluency> e- th- </disfluency> the conflicts have *-4 to be worked *-5 out /.
<1317.73002779:1322.06702779:Condoleezza_Rice:220> <disfluency> W- </disfluency> we have our own history of conflicts that *T*-1 had *-2 to be worked *-3 out after a new constitution /.
<1322.06702779:1338.01202779:Condoleezza_Rice:221> And so um the Afghans are <disfluency> working </disfluency> working on it /.
<1322.06702779:1338.01202779:Condoleezza_Rice:221> but America has stood solidly for religious freedom uh as <disfluency> a a a bedrock </disfluency> the bedrock <disfluency> of </disfluency> uh of uh democracy /.
<1322.06702779:1338.01202779:Condoleezza_Rice:221> and um we 'll see /.
<1322.06702779:1338.01202779:Condoleezza_Rice:221> but I ca n't confirm that specifically /.
<1337.48821208:1340.92921208:Tim_Russert:222> Should American Christian missionaries be encouraged *-1 *PRO*-2 to go to Afghanistan /?
<1341.35943746:1345.43123886:Condoleezza_Rice:223> Well I think that Afghans are uh pleased *PRO*-1 to get uh the help that they can get *T*-2 /.
<1345.43123886:1348.20532741:Condoleezza_Rice:224> We need *-1 to be respectful of Afghan sovereignty /.
<1347.68396434:1348.81511791:Tim_Russert:225> Including Christian missionaries /.
<1348.67996558:1371.56996558:Condoleezza_Rice:226> We have *-1 to be respectful of Afghan sovereignty and Tim respectful of the fact that this is a country that *T*-2 is coming out of twenty - five years of civil war a country that *T*-3 's going *-4 to have *-5 to find its own way and a country that *T*-6 is going through one of the most difficult uh debates that any society goes through *T*-7 /.
<1348.67996558:1371.56996558:Condoleezza_Rice:226> and that is the proper role of religion in uh the politics of the state /.
<1371.56996558:1376.82696558:Condoleezza_Rice:227> It 's a debate *ICH*-1 by the way that all of us went through *T*-2 at some point in our history /.
<1376.82696558:1387.09996558:Tim_Russert:228> But Madame Secretary we talk all the time about *PRO* spreading democracy /.
<1376.82696558:1387.09996558:Tim_Russert:228> and your own state department report on human rights abuses <disfluency> said 0 Afghanistan ha- -- </disfluency> eh says that Christianity is punishable by death <1387.09996558:1389.77940273:Tim_Russert:229> that <disfluency> a missionaries </disfluency> Christian missionaries are not welcome <1389.77940273:1394.34040273:Tim_Russert:230> that women can not get <disfluency> a </disfluency> a passport or leave the country without permission of a man /.
<1394.34040273:1400.73304732:Tim_Russert:231> This is a far cry from the responsibilities and rights given * to most people who *T*-1 live in a democracy /.
<1400.73304732:1402.83804732:Condoleezza_Rice:232> <disfluency> I- </disfluency> it 's also a far cry from the Taliban /.
<1402.83804732:1406.91904732:Condoleezza_Rice:233> This is a country that *T*-1 has come an enormous way in four years <1406.91904732:1416.72911893:Condoleezza_Rice:234> where yes the uh issues of the constitution are going *-2 to be debated *-3 in this very traditional society that *T*-4 is trying now *PRO*-5 to move to a modern political system *T*-6 /.
<1416.72911893:1420.18280975:Condoleezza_Rice:235> I would just ask people *PRO*-1 to remember how hard this was *T*-2 for us /.
<1420.18280975:1428.17178616:Condoleezza_Rice:236> Tim I am I hate *PRO*-1 to say fifty one years old /.  <1420.18280975:1428.17178616:Condoleezza_Rice:236> but it 's in my lifetime that uh black Americans were guaranteed *-1 the right *PRO* to vote /.
<1428.17178616:1434.31566737:Condoleezza_Rice:237> Who are we *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to be uh <disfluency> so </disfluency> uh eh so insistent that people must do this overnight /?
<1434.31566737:1436.15693022:Condoleezza_Rice:238> We 're <disfluency> d- </disfluency> working with the Afghan government /.
<1436.15693022:1438.23793022:Condoleezza_Rice:239> They 're moving in a democratic fashion /.
<1438.23793022:1439.43893022:Condoleezza_Rice:240> It 's going *-1 to be hard /.
<1439.43893022:1461.83193022:Condoleezza_Rice:241> But when something arises *T*-1 uh as with Mister Rahman it is the obligation *ICH*-2 of the international community and the United States and there has been support across Europe for this that the Afghans be reminded *-3 that in their own constitution they have enshrined the universal declaration on human rights which *T*-4 guarantees certain religious freedoms /.
<1461.83193022:1465.88164462:Condoleezza_Rice:242> We did n't have that constitution with the Taliban 0 *PRO* to work with *T*-1 /.  <1465.88164462:1468.24295465:Tim_Russert:243> So Christians should be able *PRO*-1 to worship /?
<1468.24295465:1471.34612146:Tim_Russert:244> People should be able *PRO*-1 to convert to Christianity in Afghanistan /.
<1470.53074979:1472.10010699:Condoleezza_Rice:245> <disfluency> O- </disfluency> of course Tim /.
<1472.10010699:1483.6192738:Condoleezza_Rice:246> <disfluency> That our </disfluency> eh the universal declaration of human rights <disfluency> is </disfluency> is clear on this /.
<1472.10010699:1483.6192738:Condoleezza_Rice:246> but I would have *-1 to say that Afghans are going *-2 to have *-3 to work through some of the difficulties and contradictions /.
<1482.56107835:1484.58298231:Tim_Russert:247> But it ca n't be done *-1 on a case by case business /.
<1484.58298231:1485.81807835:Tim_Russert:248> It has *-1 to be ensured *-2 /.
<1485.29064869:1490.76176832:Condoleezza_Rice:249> They will have *-1 to work through court cases as we have *?* *PRO*-1 to interpret the +constitution /.
<1490.76176832:1493.27476832:Condoleezza_Rice:250> They will have *-1 to work through individual cases /.
<1493.27476832:1499.8989048:Condoleezza_Rice:251> And I 'm quite certain that the evolution of Afghan democracy is going in the right direction /.
<1499.8989048:1508.89017355:Condoleezza_Rice:252> But I would just remind people that four years ago the Taliban was executing people wantonly in uh stadiums for *PRO* playing music /.
<1508.89017355:1516.05622157:Condoleezza_Rice:253> This is a country that *T*-1 has come a very very long way /.
<1508.89017355:1516.05622157:Condoleezza_Rice:253> and women were not being educated *-1 uh at all /.
<1516.05622157:1518.24372199:Condoleezza_Rice:254> It *EXP*-1 was punishable *PRO* to educate women /.
<1518.24372199:1520.6650556:Condoleezza_Rice:255> This is a place that *T*-1 has come a long long way /.
<1520.6650556:1526.047508:Condoleezza_Rice:256> *PRO* Let 's support them in uh their quest *PRO* to become <disfluency> a </disfluency> a modern democracy /.
<1525.37489469:1529.06313311:Tim_Russert:257> You mentioned 0 you 're fifty one /.
<1525.37489469:1529.06313311:Tim_Russert:257> and I 'm curious if it 's time for a career change /.
<1529.06313311:1532.85241955:Tim_Russert:258> We 've discussed uh uh future options for you on this program /.
<1532.85241955:1534.72211036:Tim_Russert:259> Here was the headline all across the paper /.
<1534.72211036:1542.82711036:Tim_Russert:260> ~NFL commisioner Paul Tagliabue step down in July /.
<1534.72211036:1542.82711036:Tim_Russert:260> and here 's our conversations in two thousand one two three and four on this subject /.
<1543.75611036:1546.54111036:Tim_Russert:261> In your next life you want *PRO*-1 to be commisioner of the ~NFL /?
<1546.04886268:1546.70598147:Condoleezza_Rice:262> Right /.
<1546.70598147:1550.77898147:Condoleezza_Rice:263> I think 0 the ~NFL is really a terrific institution /.
<1546.70598147:1550.77898147:Condoleezza_Rice:263> and I 'd love *PRO*-1 to be associated *-2 with it one day /.
<1549.9410278:1550.90143218:Tim_Russert:264> Another first /?
<1550.90143218:1554.0293134:Condoleezza_Rice:265> Uh <disfluency> I- </disfluency> Tim I 'm going off *PRO*-1 to be commisioner of ~NFL /.
<1550.90143218:1554.0293134:Condoleezza_Rice:265> *PRO* remember /?
<1554.0293134:1568.0383134:Condoleezza_Rice:266> I think 0 Paul Tagliabue 's doing a fine job as ~NFL commisioner /.
<1554.0293134:1568.0383134:Condoleezza_Rice:266> but um I look forward to uh the day that he decides *PRO*-1 to retire *T*-2 /.
<1554.0293134:1568.0383134:Condoleezza_Rice:266> and uh <disfluency> I </disfluency> I very much think that the the best job in America 's got *-1 to be ~NFL commisioner /.
<1568.24050379:1569.9545754:Tim_Russert:267> You just announced your candidacy /.
<1569.30075821:1572.23990143:Condoleezza_Rice:268> <disfluency> I </disfluency> I still think 0 the best job in America may be ~NFL commisioner /.
<1572.23990143:1573.33833024:Condoleezza_Rice:269> It 's a little too soon for me /.
<1573.33833024:1576.59925948:Condoleezza_Rice:270> I 've got lots 0 *PRO*-2 to do *T*-1 as Secretary of State /.
<1573.33833024:1576.59925948:Condoleezza_Rice:270> and <disfluency> I </disfluency> I think 0 my ship came in /.
<1576.59925948:1578.32825948:Condoleezza_Rice:271> It 's going *-1 to have *-2 to leave the port without me /.
<1578.32825948:1579.67325948:Tim_Russert:272> So you 're not interested /?
<1579.35973041:1580.47177759:Condoleezza_Rice:273> No not interested /.
<1580.1179444:1588.3109444:Tim_Russert:274> Now Fred Barns a reporter uh uh 0 *T*-1 has close <disfluency> t- </disfluency> ties to the eh sources to the White House wrote this in the Wall Street Journal the other day /.
<1588.3109444:1593.35663521:Tim_Russert:275> A third time for Bush the president 's most spectacular move would be *PRO* to annoint a presidential successor /.
<1593.35663521:1595.48441449:Tim_Russert:276> This would require Vice President Cheney to resign /.
<1595.48441449:1596.22274895:Tim_Russert:277> His replacement /?
<1596.22274895:1598.95974895:Tim_Russert:278> Condoleezza Rice who Mister Bush regards *T*-1 highly /.
<1598.95974895:1603.55672536:Condoleezza_Rice:279> We 've got a great vice president of the United States in uh Vice President Cheney /.
<1603.55672536:1608.28572536:Condoleezza_Rice:280> Uh he is uh doing a fantastic job for the president and uh for the country /.

<1616.56524937:1622.15824937:Condoleezza_Rice:282> You just gave a whole list of things 0 I have *-1 to work on *T*-2 as Secretary of State /.
<1620.65711879:1624.7424524:Tim_Russert:283> But <disfluency> if the President c- -- </disfluency> if the President came to you and said Dick Cheney 's going *-1 to resign <1624.7424524:1627.88704802:Tim_Russert:284> I want you to be my vice president because I want you to run in two thousand eight <1627.88704802:1628.92004802:Tim_Russert:285> you would n't say no /.

<2014.47131774:2015.85555616:Tim_Russert:299> And we are back /.
<2015.85555616:2016.60855616:Tim_Russert:300> Welcome all /.
<2016.60855616:2019.83860418:Tim_Russert:301> Immigration /.
<2016.60855616:2019.83860418:Tim_Russert:301> *PRO* Look at these scenes and these pictures from Los Angeles /.
<2019.83860418:2030.0071998:Tim_Russert:302> Five hundred thousand people according to police estimates turned out *PRO*-1 to protest some of the immigration reforms that *T*-2 are being discussed *-3 debated *-3 perhaps legislated *-3 in Washington /.
<2030.0071998:2038.7441998:Tim_Russert:303> David Broder how big of a political issue is immigration *T*-1 /.
<2030.0071998:2038.7441998:Tim_Russert:303> and what are the potential pitfalls for politicians *T*-2 as they try *PRO*-1 to navigate the issue /?
<2039.6651998:2049.17962861:David_Broder:304> It started as a border issue in uh states that *T*-1 have common boundaries with Mexico particularly /.
<2049.17962861:2052.34062861:David_Broder:305> Uh it has now become a national issue /.
<2052.34062861:2058.22162861:David_Broder:306> *PRO* Talking to Republican Governor of Minnesota it 's a big issue in his state /.
<2058.22162861:2064.71862861:David_Broder:307> Suburban <disfluency> t- </disfluency> Illinois districts now find large Hispanic populations /.
<2064.71862861:2071.84762861:David_Broder:308> It has become a much tougher issue for politicians of both parties but particularly I think for Republicans /.
<2071.84762861:2075.03110544:Tim_Russert:309> The polling 0 we have seen *T*-1 with the Wall Street Journal ~NBC <2075.03110544:2076.99715346:Tim_Russert:310> eighty - eight percent say 0 it 's a serious problem /.
<2076.99715346:2082.31015346:Tim_Russert:311> sixty - two percent say that <disfluency> illegal </disfluency> illegal immigrants should not be allowed *-1 to become citizens /.
<2082.31015346:2086.55915346:Tim_Russert:312> and sixty percent say that we should n't even give them guest worker status *PRO*-1 to come here temporarily /.
<2086.55915346:2088.81615346:Tim_Russert:313> Elisabeth Bumiller you wrote a piece in the New York Times <2088.81615346:2103.56915346:Tim_Russert:314> quote Bush is facing a difficult path on immigration talking about the joint pressures on President Bush from the business community we need these people to work because Americans wo n't do the jobs and the conservative community saying <disfluency> i- </disfluency> illegal immigrants get them out /.
<2103.56915346:2104.49815346:Tim_Russert:315> What does he do *T*-1 /?
<2104.49815346:2108.59658227:Elisabeth_Bumiller:316> He 's trying *PRO*-1 to uh thread the needle and walk a very fine line between both of these groups /.
<2108.59658227:2115.88558227:Elisabeth_Bumiller:317> I mean <uncertain> inches </uncertain> <disfluency> he 's <disfluency> a </disfluency> you know a governor of -- </disfluency> he 's a former governor of a border state /.
<2108.59658227:2115.88558227:Elisabeth_Bumiller:317> so <disfluency> he </disfluency> this is very close to his political experience /.
<2115.88558227:2129.66258227:Elisabeth_Bumiller:318> <disfluency> Emotionally he is i- <unintelligible> -- </disfluency> in the early days of this debate in two thousand four he was giving very emotional speeches about America the land of immigrants /.
<2115.88558227:2129.66258227:Elisabeth_Bumiller:318> and he was proposing <disfluency> this this very </disfluency> what many Republicans said 0 *T*-1 was a very generous guest worker program /.
<2129.66258227:2137.76758227:Elisabeth_Bumiller:319> Um he has pulled back a lot now ah <disfluency> under </disfluency> under onslaught <disfluency> from </disfluency> from conservatives /.
<2129.66258227:2137.76758227:Elisabeth_Bumiller:319> and now he 's emphasizing the border security part of his plan /.
<2137.76758227:2139.17985944:Elisabeth_Bumiller:320> He 's trying *PRO*-1 to do both /.
<2139.17985944:2142.18741547:Elisabeth_Bumiller:321> <disfluency> There 's a lot -- </disfluency> as we know *?* there 's a lot of different proposals on the hill right now /.
<2142.18741547:2143.65241547:Elisabeth_Bumiller:322> We 'll see some of them next week /.
<2143.65241547:2150.45341547:Elisabeth_Bumiller:323> Um the White House is hanging back *PRO*-1 waiting *PRO*-2 to see <disfluency> what </disfluency> what *T*-3 comes <disfluency> out of th- -- </disfluency> out of the smoke /.
<2143.65241547:2150.45341547:Elisabeth_Bumiller:323> and then <disfluency> we 'll -- </disfluency> we 'll weigh in /.
<2150.45341547:2158.99967663:Tim_Russert:324> Charlie Cook it appears that the American people have very firm views about immigration and that the President and other politicians are kind of trying *PRO*-1 to nuance the issue /.
<2158.99967663:2159.98467663:Tim_Russert:325> Is that possible /?
<2159.98467663:2161.3514458:Charlie_Cook:326> Well it 's a funny issue /.
<2161.3514458:2170.55480637:Charlie_Cook:327> If you ask me what *T*-1 's the most important problem facing the country it 's a small single digit issue /.
<2161.3514458:2170.55480637:Charlie_Cook:327> but then once 0 you raise it boy emotions run high /.
<2161.3514458:2170.55480637:Charlie_Cook:327> and it *EXP*-1 's hard *PRO* to split the baby /.
<2170.55480637:2179.18780637:Charlie_Cook:328> <disfluency> And </disfluency> and I can see where the president 's trying *PRO*-1 to go *T*-2 the *PRO* let 's <disfluency> build </disfluency> build a wall or build a barrier stop illegal immigration /.
<2179.18780637:2185.48480637:Charlie_Cook:329> But for the people 0 we have *T*-1 we got *PRO*-2 to mainstream them and keep this workforce going because that 's important for agribusiness and business /.
<2185.48480637:2188.01380637:Tim_Russert:330> Is that politically acceptable to conservatives /?
<2188.01380637:2196.51080637:Charlie_Cook:331> Eh it 's not acceptable to anybody /.
<2188.01380637:2196.51080637:Charlie_Cook:331> but it 's the only way I think /-
<2188.01380637:2196.51080637:Charlie_Cook:331> I mean they 're going *-1 to have *-2 to figure out a way 0 *PRO* to split the baby *T*-3 because one way or the other <disfluency> is is is </disfluency> is just not going *-4 to work /.
<2196.56681045:2197.16781045:Tim_Russert:332> John /?
<2197.16781045:2199.86926874:John_Harwood:333> Well *PRO* let 's do n't forget Tim 0 Democrats are also split *-1 on this issue /.
<2199.86926874:2204.06226874:John_Harwood:334> Lot of African - Americans are not very sympathetic with the cause of the guest worker program /.
<2204.06226874:2212.27979275:John_Harwood:335> Uh the White House <disfluency> one of the ways </disfluency> Elisabeth mentioned *PRO* trying to thread the needle one of the things 0 they were looking at *T*-1 is *PRO* trying *PRO*-2 to push the final resolution of this until after the midterm election /.
<2212.27979275:2219.41679275:John_Harwood:336> That also could happen on some budget issues as well as a way of *PRO* trying *PRO*-1 to make some sort of common cause between moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans /.
<2219.41679275:2221.70664364:Tim_Russert:337> You know in two thousand Florida Florida Florida /.
<2221.70664364:2223.58690817:Tim_Russert:338> Two thousand four Ohio Ohio Ohio /.
<2223.58690817:2231.75987447:Tim_Russert:339> You look at two thousand eight that electoral college map /.
<2223.58690817:2231.75987447:Tim_Russert:339> and you look at states like New Mexico and Arizona and Colorado some real potential swing states /.
<2231.75987447:2234.61356529:Tim_Russert:340> And this issue could be very decisive as we play it through /.
<2234.61356529:2236.14139932:John_Harwood:341> Well *PRO* let 's <disfluency> do- </disfluency> do n't forget one other thing Tim /.
<2236.14139932:2243.28125695:John_Harwood:342> This was raised *-1 in the Virginia governor 's race last year by the republican candidate who *T*-2 went after some of these job centers that *T*-3 attract illegal immigrants /.
<2243.28125695:2247.50625695:John_Harwood:343> *PRO* Did n't work for him /.
<2243.28125695:2247.50625695:John_Harwood:343> so sometimes the emotion of the issue does n't always prevail /.
<2247.50625695:2248.93268576:Tim_Russert:344> *PRO* Let me turn to Iraq <2248.93268576:2254.12599578:Tim_Russert:345> the big discussion in our country about Iraq the way 0 the issue is being covered *-1 by the media *T*-2 /.
<2254.12599578:2257.073139:Tim_Russert:346> Uh Vice President Cheney last Sunday made these comments /.
<2257.073139:2262.46354423:Tim_Russert:347> There 's a constant sort of perception if you will *?* that *T*-1 is created *-2 because what *T*-3 's newsworthy is the car bomb in Baghdad <2262.46354423:2268.78454423:Tim_Russert:348> it 's not all the work that *T*-4 went on that day in fifteen other provinces in terms of *PRO* making progress towards *PRO* rebuilding Iraq /.
<2268.78454423:2270.74978939:Tim_Russert:349> Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld weighed in /.
<2270.74978939:2273.23823504:Tim_Russert:350> The terrorists seem *-1 to recognize that they 're losing in Iraq /.
<2273.23823504:2275.63811626:Tim_Russert:351> I believe that history will show that to be the case /.
<2275.63811626:2282.05118453:Tim_Russert:352> Fortunately history is not made *-1 up of daily headlines blogs on the websites or the latest sensational attack /.
<2282.05118453:2288.69141638:Tim_Russert:353> And then this Wednesday President Bush went to a town meeting in West Virginia of his supporters /.
<2282.05118453:2288.69141638:Tim_Russert:353> and here 's one of the questions that *T*-1 was asked *-2 /.
<2288.69141638:2297.75953231:speaker2:354> And I ask you this from the bottom of my heart for a solution to this because it seems that our major media networks do n't want *PRO*-1 to portray the good . <2297.75953231:2299.67280969:speaker2:355> They just want *PRO*-2 to focus /-
<2304.74680969:2306.18780969:President_George_W._Bush:356> Okay *PRO* hold on a second /.
<2307.12085084:2315.38585084:speaker2:357> They just want *PRO*-1 to focus on another car bomb /.
<2307.12085084:2315.38585084:speaker2:357> or they just want *PRO*-1 to focus on some more bloodshed /.
<2315.38585084:2321.16285084:Tim_Russert:358> Does that issue *ICH*-1 work that <disfluency> th- </disfluency> it 's the mainstream media that *T*-2 's distorting the good news that *T*-3 's coming out of Iraq /?
<2321.16285084:2325.30296677:Charlie_Cook:359> I think 0 it helps with the republican base /.
<2321.16285084:2325.30296677:Charlie_Cook:359> but I do n't think 0 it helps with swing voters at all /.
<2325.30296677:2326.70810545:Charlie_Cook:360> First of all it 's the nature of news /.
<2326.70810545:2330.33761683:Charlie_Cook:361> I mean on the evening news at night a car that *T*-1 is n't in a wreck is n't in the news /.
<2330.33761683:2333.61754641:Charlie_Cook:362> A house that *T*-1 does n't burn a building that *T*-2 does n't burn a killing that *T*-3 does n't take place /.
<2333.61754641:2337.22687144:Charlie_Cook:363> News <disfluency> is when -- </disfluency> is the aberration is the change from normalcy /.
<2337.22687144:2341.91028965:Charlie_Cook:364> Secondly <disfluency> this </disfluency> uh eighty journalists so far have been killed *-1 over there /.
<2341.91028965:2350.03928965:Charlie_Cook:365> Um I mean <disfluency> it 's -- it 's -- it 's -- </disfluency> I mean *PRO* getting out there and looking around wandering around Iraq *PRO*-1 looking for good news sounds to me like a good way 0 *PRO* to get killed *-2 *T*-3 /.
<2350.03928965:2357.89870785:Charlie_Cook:366> And then the third thing is that <disfluency> I </disfluency> I do n't know if they really want *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to sell this because people do n't think <disfluency> that that </disfluency> uh that everything 's fine /.
<2357.89870785:2361.96370785:Charlie_Cook:367> <disfluency> I mea- </disfluency> I think 0 this is just an extenuation of *PRO* holding the banner that *T*-1 says mission accomplished *-2 /.
<2361.96370785:2363.29266019:Charlie_Cook:368> The people do n't think 0 it 's well /.
<2363.29266019:2364.89366019:Charlie_Cook:369> They can see that it 's not going well /.
<2364.89366019:2367.21535792:Charlie_Cook:370> And what *T*-1 happens in fifteen provinces does n't matter /.
<2367.21535792:2374.24138068:Charlie_Cook:371> <disfluency> What </disfluency> if they think that this thing is just really going to hell in a handbasket um <disfluency> it 's ki- -- </disfluency> I mean <disfluency> that 's what -- </disfluency> you know that 's that /.
<2374.24138068:2375.41038068:Tim_Russert:372> David Broder /?
<2376.24338068:2387.06038068:David_Broder:373> The ombudsman at The Post Deborah Howell has a very thoughtful analysis of this question in the paper *ICH*-1 today which I would refer people to *T*-2 /.
<2387.06038068:2398.45338068:David_Broder:374> I think 0 the answer is that when there is this level of violence and turmoil in a country *T*-1 that has *-2 to be the heart of the story that the press <disfluency> is </disfluency> is telling *T*-3 /.
<2398.45338068:2407.65298523:David_Broder:375> The other parts of it do get told *-1 /.
<2398.45338068:2407.65298523:David_Broder:375> but they do not dominate the news /.
<2398.45338068:2407.65298523:David_Broder:375> and they ca n't dominate the news given the realities of that country /.
<2407.4023236:2408.6673236:John_Harwood:376> Nor should they dominate the news /.
<2408.6673236:2409.86725318:John_Harwood:377> It 's a very weak argument /.
<2409.86725318:2421.28146229:John_Harwood:378> <disfluency> When </disfluency> when you have as Charlie said *?* journalists over there who *T*-1 can not move around the country *PRO*-2 to report because they know <disfluency> that </disfluency> that they 're in danger of *PRO*-3 being killed *-4 at any moment *T*-5 that tells you about the state of security in the country /.
<2421.28146229:2422.33636911:John_Harwood:379> It 's not good /.
<2422.33636911:2423.22778732:John_Harwood:380> The White House /?
<2422.34749793:2426.54221841:Elisabeth_Bumiller:381> <disfluency> Y- </disfluency> the other thing that *T*-1 's interesting what you did n't show *T*-2 was the President 's response to her /.
<2426.54221841:2431.27917075:Elisabeth_Bumiller:382> I was there that day /.
<2426.54221841:2431.27917075:Elisabeth_Bumiller:382> and he was very very careful *PRO* not to jump on her bandwagon /.
<2431.27917075:2433.66449578:Elisabeth_Bumiller:383> In fact uh I mean obviously he did n't have *-1 to *?* /.
<2433.66449578:2436.75623902:Elisabeth_Bumiller:384> She did it for him /.
<2433.66449578:2436.75623902:Elisabeth_Bumiller:384> but the point is he said *PRO* look , *PRO* wait a minute /.
<2436.75623902:2441.41598226:Elisabeth_Bumiller:385> You know um I understand your frustration /.
<2436.75623902:2441.41598226:Elisabeth_Bumiller:385> but um we have a free press in this country /.
<2441.41598226:2442.79019136:Elisabeth_Bumiller:386> We ca n't tell them what *PRO*-2 to do *T*-1 /.
<2442.79019136:2450.18319136:Elisabeth_Bumiller:387> He pulled back somewhat from her comment /.
<2442.79019136:2450.18319136:Elisabeth_Bumiller:387> and I think 0 you 're right Charlie that <disfluency> they are n't -- </disfluency> they know 0 they ca n't sell this and when they 've tried in the past *T*-1 it has backfired on them /.
<2450.18319136:2454.12019136:Tim_Russert:388> But the President also said *PRO* do n't be afraid *PRO*-1 to go to blogs and find out some more information /.
<2452.62603293:2456.96373066:Elisabeth_Bumiller:389> Yes I mean <disfluency> s- </disfluency> I mean <disfluency> I 'm d- -- </disfluency> <disfluency> I 'm -- </disfluency> these are gradations here <disfluency> in Wh- -- </disfluency> in White House response /.
<2456.98191915:2465.54291915:Tim_Russert:390> But is the White House convinced *-1 that in order *PRO* to secure the base of the Republican Party for the President it *EXP*-2 does n't hurt *PRO* to go after the media a little bit /?
<2465.54291915:2466.79047604:Elisabeth_Bumiller:391> <disfluency> Not n- </disfluency> of course not /.
<2466.79047604:2467.87147604:Elisabeth_Bumiller:392> They do it all the time /.
<2467.87147604:2471.32847604:Elisabeth_Bumiller:393> <disfluency> And </disfluency> uh and they complain all the time <disfluency> about about </disfluency> about what we do *T*-1 /.
<2471.32847604:2477.99240562:Elisabeth_Bumiller:394> <disfluency> But </disfluency> but <disfluency> I </disfluency> I have noticed this past week Scott McClellan *ICH*-1 saying the White House Press Secretary you know 0 we 're not blaming the media for the war in Iraq /.
<2477.99240562:2479.32382383:Elisabeth_Bumiller:395> He said that a couple times this week /.
<2479.32382383:2483.4841261:Elisabeth_Bumiller:396> And <disfluency> so </disfluency> so <disfluency> it 's -- i- </disfluency> <disfluency> they 're -- </disfluency> <disfluency> they 're -- </disfluency> again they 're being a little more careful here than usual /.
<2483.22805656:2487.23775428:Tim_Russert:397> And did you really fall *-1 asleep in that press pool /.
<2483.22805656:2487.23775428:Tim_Russert:397> or was that a cheap shot by the President /?
<2487.23775428:2488.84079979:Elisabeth_Bumiller:398> That 's completely inaccurate /.
<2488.97019524:2492.44631117:Elisabeth_Bumiller:399> I wo n't say 0 I have n't nodded off in previous speeches but not that one /.
<2492.44631117:2495.59131117:Tim_Russert:400> There is a <disfluency> difference +between -- </disfluency> difference +between meditation and sleep /.
<2495.59131117:2503.63365896:Tim_Russert:401> <disfluency> The </disfluency> uh David Broder *PRO* let me turn to <disfluency> the </disfluency> the rebellion that I sense *T*-1 with some House members uh particularly in the Republican Party when you go *PRO*-2 talk to them privately *T*-3 /.
<2503.63365896:2505.74286463:Tim_Russert:402> You captured it in your column this way /.
<2505.74286463:2515.95630902:Tim_Russert:403> The conflict over the Dubai Ports World brought to the surface deep - seated resentments from the Capitol end of Pennsylvania Avenue toward the people around the President and surprisingly toward Bush himself /.
<2515.95630902:2524.09154088:Tim_Russert:404> The harmony that *T*-1 had prevailed during most of Bush 's tenure the deference that a Republican controlled Congress has generally shown *T*-2 to his wishes disappeared /.
<2524.09154088:2530.66156364:Tim_Russert:405> Even the normal circumspection with which congressional Republicans treat the White House *T*-1 withered in the heat of this dispute /.
<2530.66156364:2531.53688652:Tim_Russert:406> And then this /.
<2531.53688652:2540.60290928:Tim_Russert:407> Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia a committee chairman told The Post 0 this is probably the worst administration ever in *PRO* getting Congress ' opinion on anything /.
<2540.60290928:2541.45990928:Tim_Russert:408> Ouch /.
<2541.45990928:2548.95514114:David_Broder:409> Well you had heard this kind of comment all of us had *?* privately from Republicans on the hill /.
<2548.95514114:2570.73367313:David_Broder:410> But the fact that somebody like Tom Davis former chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee is saying it publicly on the record <disfluency> s- </disfluency> uh gives you a measure of the sort of fall - off of any sense of either loyalty or intimidation whatever you want *PRO*-1 to call it *PRO*-3 *T*-2 to the White House /.
<2570.73367313:2578.47867313:David_Broder:411> Uh they uh feel that they 're on their own and that the President is going *-1 to take care of his business but they 're going *-2 to take care of their own /.
<2578.47867313:2582.57530043:Tim_Russert:412> One of the things being talked about * Elisabeth Bumiller is the staff shake - up at the White House /.
<2582.57530043:2583.93630043:Tim_Russert:413> This is how you reported it *T*-1 /.
<2583.93630043:2597.95995264:Tim_Russert:414> Republicans outside the White House say 0 that had pushed Mister Bush uh *PRO*-1 not to replace Karl Rove the chief uh political operator Deputy uh Chief of Staff but rather to bring in someone at the same level or above perhaps as minister without portfolio /.
<2597.95995264:2607.77657995:Tim_Russert:415> One Republican said 0 Mister Bush should view it as *PRO* replacing a top - notch pitcher struggling in the later innings of a baseball game rather than as a vote of no - confidence in a friend /.
<2607.77657995:2608.88957995:Tim_Russert:416> So who 's the reliever *T*-1 /?
<2608.88957995:2612.30246402:Elisabeth_Bumiller:417> Well there 's lots of names that they /-
<2608.88957995:2612.30246402:Elisabeth_Bumiller:417> You 've heard them as well as I have *?* /.
<2612.30246402:2615.56257995:Elisabeth_Bumiller:418> Ed Gillespie uh you know Bill Paxon /.
<2612.30246402:2615.56257995:Elisabeth_Bumiller:418> there 's lots of names /.
<2615.56257995:2620.53432319:Elisabeth_Bumiller:419> Um the question is are they going *-1 to do it /.
<2615.56257995:2620.53432319:Elisabeth_Bumiller:419> <disfluency> and </disfluency> and right now <disfluency> there 's -- </disfluency> there 's a lot of talk at the White House /.
<2620.53432319:2623.54332319:Elisabeth_Bumiller:420> There 's no indication that the President has signed on to this idea /.
<2623.54332319:2629.6639505:Elisabeth_Bumiller:421> Karl Rove has told people that he thinks that *PRO* bringing somebody in without a clear line of authority is a mistake /.
<2629.6639505:2633.81416999:Elisabeth_Bumiller:422> <disfluency> It </disfluency> <disfluency> and </disfluency> and uh <disfluency> th- </disfluency> the bottom line is <disfluency> what is this going *-1 to d- *T*-3 -- </disfluency> is this going *-2 to help with the war in Iraq /?
<2633.81416999:2645.78190457:Elisabeth_Bumiller:423> <disfluency> It 's going *-1 to help with -- </disfluency> you know <disfluency> tha- that 's -- </disfluency> <disfluency> it 's -- </disfluency> <disfluency> is it goi- -- </disfluency> you know <disfluency> we 're n- -- </disfluency> we 're not talking about *PRO* changing policies here /.
<2633.81416999:2645.78190457:Elisabeth_Bumiller:423> we 're <disfluency> changing about -- </disfluency> you know changing you know <disfluency> some </disfluency> some personnel /.
<2633.81416999:2645.78190457:Elisabeth_Bumiller:423> so <disfluency> i- </disfluency> that 's /-
<2633.81416999:2645.78190457:Elisabeth_Bumiller:423> it *EXP*-1 's unclear if anything 's going *-2 to happen /.
<2645.78190457:2646.59890457:Tim_Russert:424> John /?
<2646.59890457:2648.49478438:John_Harwood:425> Well chances *ICH*-1 are pretty good 0 something will happen /.
<2648.49478438:2652.08614591:John_Harwood:426> The President of course did n't rule out the idea of *PRO* bringing someone on /.
<2652.08614591:2653.46681571:John_Harwood:427> Bill Paxon 's a possibility /.
<2653.46681571:2655.16381571:John_Harwood:428> Vin Weber 's also a possibility /.
<2655.16381571:2658.50474494:John_Harwood:429> And I think 0 over time you could see some changes in the White House staff as well /.
<2658.50474494:2668.06534056:John_Harwood:430> When you look at sort of <disfluency> the </disfluency> the big three or <disfluency> or th- </disfluency> the biggest names in the White House Andy Card Karl Rove Dan Bartlett *T*-1 you could see some change over time /.
<2668.06534056:2671.14231697:John_Harwood:431> Andy Card probably the most likely 0 *T*-1 to leave at some point /.
<2671.14231697:2674.4690794:John_Harwood:432> He 's almost uh already the longest serving Chief of Staff ever /.
<2674.4690794:2675.87624621:John_Harwood:433> You could see some change there /.
<2674.9789385:2679.61524768:Tim_Russert:434> <disfluency> On </disfluency> on the verge of *PRO* dethroning Sherman Adams of Dwight Eisenhower fame /.
<2677.96124684:2678.77000842:John_Harwood:435> You bet /.
<2679.8820556:2683.72484162:Tim_Russert:436> Uh *PRO* let me turn to the midterm elections where <disfluency> th- </disfluency> all these things +invariably lead *T*-1 /.
<2683.72484162:2687.10612805:Tim_Russert:437> Here 's our latest numbers in the Wall Street Journal poll right track wrong track /.
<2687.10612805:2690.07436647:Tim_Russert:438> United States headed in the right direction twenty - six percent /.
<2690.07436647:2690.95317607:Tim_Russert:439> One of four /.
<2690.95317607:2696.7439385:Tim_Russert:440> Sixty - two percent say wrong track /.
<2690.95317607:2696.7439385:Tim_Russert:440> and the so called generic question who do you want *T*-1 to control Congress /.
<2696.7439385:2705.40120135:Tim_Russert:441> Republicans thirty - seven percent /.
<2696.7439385:2705.40120135:Tim_Russert:441> Fifty percent now a majority say the Democrats /.
<2696.7439385:2705.40120135:Tim_Russert:441> but as always Charlie Cook is warning of us *PRO*-1 to go slow /.
<2705.40120135:2707.85820135:Tim_Russert:442> And here 's his latest column from the National Journal /.
<2707.85820135:2719.78572536:Tim_Russert:443> Despite national political trends indicating that the ~GOP is in serious trouble a race by race micro-analysis suggests that Democrats can not easily seize control of the House or Senate this fall /.
<2719.78572536:2722.85434457:Tim_Russert:444> In the Senate Democrats need a net gain of six seats /.
<2722.85434457:2738.305369:Tim_Russert:445> Democrats need *-1 to win in Tennessee where Bill Frist is retiring *T*-2 have *-1 to run the table by *PRO*-3 defeating all the most vulnerable Republicans while *PRO*-4 holding all of their own seats including in Minnesota where their incumbent is retiring *T*-5 and in Washington state where Senator Maria Cantwell faces a very strong challenger *T*-6 /.
<2738.305369:2744.62556024:Tim_Russert:446> They also need *-1 to hang on to somewhat more secure open seats in Maryland and Vermont as well as fourteen other incumbents /.
<2744.62556024:2752.75456024:Tim_Russert:447> Although not impossible in a favorable <disfluency> +political </disfluency> political climate this is a very tall order /.
<2744.62556024:2752.75456024:Tim_Russert:447> and here are the vulnerable states according to the Cook report /.
<2752.75456024:2761.42567987:Tim_Russert:448> Uh vulnerable senators Conrad Burns in Montana Lincoln Chafee Rhode Island Mike DeWine Ohio Santorum in Pennsylvania Jim Talent Missouri and the Tennessee seat /.
<2761.42567987:2763.01067987:Tim_Russert:449> Charlie what do you see *T*-1 in the Senate /?
<2763.01067987:2771.47567987:Charlie_Cook:450> <disfluency> This is -- </disfluency> you know when you look at this election from the big picture the national numbers *T*-1 boy *PRO* just looks horrible /.
<2763.01067987:2771.47567987:Charlie_Cook:450> and it looks like gosh Republicans will be lucky if they hold onto anything /.
<2771.47567987:2773.44427548:Charlie_Cook:451> And then you do the race by race like this /.
<2773.44427548:2777.57327548:Charlie_Cook:452> Now the thing is the first three or four for Democrats probably are n't that hard /.
<2777.57327548:2785.3011567:Charlie_Cook:453> But when you get to the fifth and sixth seats *T*-1 you get <disfluency> to to </disfluency> to *PRO* winning in Ohio <disfluency> and you wi- -- </disfluency> and <disfluency> an- an- </disfluency> talking about the Tennessee open seat /.
<2785.3011567:2786.33991912:Charlie_Cook:454> Gosh that 's hard /.
<2786.33991912:2790.56491912:Charlie_Cook:455> I mean it 's going *-1 to take a real real real strong wind up their backs /.
<2790.56491912:2793.94406234:Charlie_Cook:456> <disfluency> And </disfluency> and it 's the kind of thing where there 's structural barriers *T*-1 /.
<2793.94406234:2797.23851474:Charlie_Cook:457> I mean eighty - five percent of all incumbent senators get reelected *-1 /.
<2797.23851474:2799.17551474:Charlie_Cook:458> And you 've got *-1 to knock out five of them /?  <2799.17551474:2801.46156276:Charlie_Cook:459> Now it can happen /.

<2799.17551474:2801.46156276:Charlie_Cook:459> but it 's hard /.
<2801.46156276:2811.84218197:Charlie_Cook:460> And it 's kind of like *PRO* having uh structural barriers that *T*-1 are out there that *T*-2 are protecting the Republican majorities /.
<2801.46156276:2811.84218197:Charlie_Cook:460> and if this is a category one two or three hurricane those barriers are strong enough /.
<2811.84218197:2814.0969444:Charlie_Cook:461> but if it 's a four or five they 're not *?* /.
<2814.0969444:2815.65290649:Charlie_Cook:462> And the question is how tall <disfluency> it </disfluency> will it be *T*-1 /.
<2815.65290649:2819.54844482:Charlie_Cook:463> And Tim <disfluency> some of the- -- </disfluency> some of those <disfluency> ranges </disfluency> races can change overnight in a hurry /.
<2819.54844482:2822.99739764:Charlie_Cook:464> Conrad Burns has now got a primary challenge from a significant Republican /.
<2822.99739764:2828.28185088:Charlie_Cook:465> There 's some talk *ICH*-1 among Republicans that maybe Conrad Burns would find something else 0 *PRO* to do *T*-2 maybe in the Bush administration /.
<2828.28185088:2829.65085088:Charlie_Cook:466> That could change in a hurry /.
<2829.65085088:2831.79585088:Tim_Russert:467> Charlie you also say this about the House /.
<2831.79585088:2838.20230329:Tim_Russert:468> In the House where Democrats need a net gain of fifteen seats *T*-1 only about three dozen are truly in play today /.
<2838.20230329:2842.78837489:Tim_Russert:469> So <disfluency> it 's -- </disfluency> it 's <disfluency> i- </disfluency> tough /.
<2838.20230329:2842.78837489:Tim_Russert:469> and you have *-1 to get <disfluency> a a a s- </disfluency> <disfluency> a straight </disfluency> an inside straight /.
<2842.78837489:2846.7424465:Charlie_Cook:470> Right there 're basically twenty - four republican seats that *T*-1 today are vulnerable /.
<2846.7424465:2851.8394465:Charlie_Cook:471> Democrats have *-1 to win fifteen out of twenty - four and hold on to their eleven <disfluency> most tou- </disfluency> the toughest ones /.
<2851.8394465:2853.25930413:Charlie_Cook:472> And again they can do it /.
<2853.25930413:2866.05520893:Charlie_Cook:473> <disfluency> The- </disfluency> <disfluency> there d- </disfluency> <disfluency> i- if </disfluency> if there were more Republican retirements in tough districts , if uh /-
<2853.25930413:2866.05520893:Charlie_Cook:473> But redistricting and the incumbency advantages that *T*-1 have built over the years just make *PRO* pulling this kind of win hard unless it 's a category four or five /.
<2866.05520893:2872.38420893:Tim_Russert:474> Well <disfluency> in </disfluency> in nineteen ninety - four you talked about micro-changes thirty to thirty - five seats in the House /.
<2866.05520893:2872.38420893:Tim_Russert:474> and the tsunami came /.
<2872.38420893:2876.79499495:Tim_Russert:475> Republicans won fifty - two seats uh *PRO*-1 electing Newt Gingrich Speaker of the House /.
<2876.79499495:2883.97999495:Tim_Russert:476> Newt Gingrich has now weighed in David Broder and said that the Democrats ' slogan in two thousand <disfluency> shits </disfluency> six should be *PRO* had enough /.
<2883.97999495:2885.68535215:Tim_Russert:477> And he thinks 0 that would work /.
<2885.68535215:2889.56149537:David_Broder:478> What a <disfluency> l- </disfluency> helper Gingrich is *T*-1 /.
<2889.56149537:2896.94649537:David_Broder:479> Uh I think 0 the Democrats ' real slogan may very well be would n't you like *PRO*-1 to have somebody watching the store <2896.94649537:2910.69801938:David_Broder:480> because the sense that I get *T*-2 from *PRO*-3 talking to voters is that they are not ready *PRO*-4 to entrust the government to the Democrats but they 're not really comfortable <disfluency> th- </disfluency> with the way 0 the Republicans have been running things *T*-5 /.
<2910.69801938:2922.23501938:David_Broder:481> And the simple idea of *PRO* having a little oversight uh little checks and balances back in the system is potentially a really powerful argument for Democrats /.
<2921.39848357:2930.64665038:Tim_Russert:482> Elisabeth Bumiller when <disfluency> y- re- </disfluency> the White House hears little oversight checks and balances *T*-1 to them it means hearings with subpoena power *T*-2 /.
<2921.39848357:2930.64665038:Tim_Russert:482> and they do n't like that /.  <2928.87952822:2929.63774221:Elisabeth_Bumiller:483> That 's right /.
<2930.64665038:2939.55017439:Elisabeth_Bumiller:484> No no /.
<2930.64665038:2939.55017439:Elisabeth_Bumiller:484> and you know Karl Rove has told people 0 he 's optomistic 0 they can hang on to both Houses um uh <disfluency> if </disfluency> if /-
<2930.64665038:2939.55017439:Elisabeth_Bumiller:484> But he also has said yes it can happen the way 0 Charlie Cook says *T*-1 /.

<2939.55017439:2947.2053412:Elisabeth_Bumiller:485> <disfluency> He 's -- </disfluency> the President 's out a lot these days *PRO*-1 campaigning already *PRO*-1 raising money for candidates /.
<2939.55017439:2947.2053412:Elisabeth_Bumiller:485> and uh he 's out in <disfluency> the </disfluency> all these big states /.
<2947.2053412:2954.61460404:Tim_Russert:486> Because the last thing 0 the White House wants *T*-1 is investigation into weapons of mass destruction and to prison abuse and to religious rights in Afghanistan /.
<2954.61460404:2956.54212805:Tim_Russert:487> *PRO* <disfluency> Drop </disfluency> drop the issue /.
<2954.61460404:2956.54212805:Tim_Russert:487> and there 's a hearing /.
<2956.54212805:2960.38129486:Elisabeth_Bumiller:488> <disfluency> Ri- </disfluency> I mean <disfluency> it 's the last </disfluency> that 's the last two years of the Bush presidency then <unintelligible> /.
<2956.54212805:2960.38129486:Elisabeth_Bumiller:488> and they know that /.  <2959.51137321:2966.44939764:John_Harwood:489> That 's true Tim /.
<2959.51137321:2966.44939764:John_Harwood:489> but *PRO* let 's keep in mind first of all 0 *PRO* keeping Republican majority is not the top priority for this White House /.
<2966.44939764:2968.36418366:John_Harwood:490> *PRO* Winning the war in Iraq is the top priority /.
<2968.36418366:2974.58001769:John_Harwood:491> And secondly it might not be the worst thing 0 *T*-1 to happen to George ~W Bush if Democrats had a weak majority /.
<2974.58001769:2983.46101769:John_Harwood:492> You could see some deals cut especially on entitlement programs the last two years if Democrats try *PRO*-1 to resolve a problem before they hope they get a president in two thousand nine /.
<2982.86436394:2991.15336394:Tim_Russert:493> David is it *ICH*-1 enough for the Democrats to say we 're not the Republicans period /.
<2982.86436394:2991.15336394:Tim_Russert:493> or do they have *-1 to come forward with a specific proposal *PRO* to deal with these problems including Iraq /?

<2995.74334035:3008.1947936:David_Broder:495> And the great void on the Democratic side is 0 nobody can tell you today what their policy *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 about Iraq about entitlements or about any of the other challenges facing the country /.
